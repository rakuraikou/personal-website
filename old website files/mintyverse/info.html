      <h2>Locations</h2>
      <p><i>Mintyverse primarily takes place in a city known as Asteropolis. Characters can be found in specific locations, but may move around over the course of the game. Each area also has various challenges for Minty to overcome (though, they are only considered "challenges" because she isn't used to being out of the house...)</i></p>

      <h5>Minty's House</h5>
      <p style="text-align: justify">Minty lives with her parents and younger brother in the metro area. The house is already a bit too big for the family, but her brother's absence for school has made it feel all the more empty. The house itself is pretty plain, as one would expect with a cookie-cutter suburban home.
      <br>
      <span style="color:#8f8f8f"><i>Characters present: Minty's mom, Minty's dad</i></span>
      </p>
      
      <h5>Pine Blossom Shopping Mall</h5>
      <p style="text-align: justify">Asteropolis' local mall - a solid 25 minute bus ride from Minty's house, which makes it <i>just</i> inconvenient enough for regular trips. With a plethora of stores and activities, it makes a popular site for patrons of all ages and interests. Pine trees don't actually have blossoms.
      <br>
      <span style="color:#8f8f8f"><i>Characters present: Lychee, Bonnie, Mai, Sugar, Mano, Ash</i></span>
      </p>
      
      <h5>YO-LO Wellness Center</h5>
      <p style="text-align: justify">The YO-LO Wellness Center houses an overwhelming amount of exercise equipment, spaces for various athletic activities and a snack shop. Interestingly enough, there is a robotics club that meets in one of the multipurpose rooms, but it's relatively small due to most prospective members being too intimidated to pass through the gym to get there.
      <br>
      <span style="color:#8f8f8f"><i>Characters present: Kim, Jayla, Nell, Hammy, Ika</i></span>
      </p>
      
      <h5>Clout Nine</h5>
      <p style="text-align: justify">Open all hours of the night, Clout Nine is the center of all night life in Asteropolis. It's also open during the daytime, but there isn't much to do there beyond awkwardly ordering a cocktail at 2pm. They're currently trying to expand their menu and event schedule to facilitate "day life" profit, as a healthy capitalist would.
      <br>
      <span style="color:#8f8f8f"><i>Characters present: Wes, Danyel, Aria, Matt</i></span>
      </p>
      
      <h5>University of Asten</h5>
      <p style="text-align: justify">At an economically convenient distance from many downtown amenities is the state university. The University of Asten boasts a large enrollment and graduation rate and a wide variety of programs. Minty's brother, Fern, attends this school for pre-med. Minty herself attended this school for computer science, but has yet to do anything meaningful with the degree.
      <br>
      <span style="color:#8f8f8f"><i>Characters present: Fern, Diego, Huynh, Luck, Amy</i></span>
