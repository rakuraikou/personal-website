      Under the sheer veil of glory and grandeur, the world of Luxos hides dark secrets. Reports of creatures uncharacteristically wreaking havoc have been on the rise, threatening the stability of civilization. Four unrelated denizens all find themselves individually tied up in the situation, with one unknowingly existing as its catalyst. After a chance encounter, these four decide to band together and resolve their burdens as a team, growing into Luxosâ€™ greatest heroes.

      <u>Bolt from the Blue</u> is my evil love letter and affectionate hate crime towards the JRPG genre (specifically modern ones that try to emulate/adapt the golden age formula) (specifically Bravely Default). It's a worldbuilding project I've had since December 2020, and I intend on making it into a game.

      The first idea for the story actually came from a random dream I had. I soon gave the characters names and faces, and a dear friend who I explained the dream to helped me come up with the story's first title: An Untitled Reverie. Funny. Anyway, for a while, Bolt from the Blue was just a self-indulgent universe that I could just do whatever I wanted with. I don't remember exactly when I started really getting into the worldbuilding of it all, I'd probably say around March 2021.

      As excited as I always have been about my characters and worlds, I am extremely shy about sharing my creations. This website's purpose is to encourage me to be more open about the things I make. It's actually pretty fun building the site, so that dampens the anxiety a bit lols. In any case, thanks for checking out the site!!
