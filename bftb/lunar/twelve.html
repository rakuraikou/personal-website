              I have such mixed feelings about Raiden. It's a little annoying, the way she tails me and asks me what I need. I get it's her job, but it almost feels like pity at this point. She knows what I want - I want her to do whatever it was she did at the meadow so that I can use my magic. Nothing matters more to me than being able to protect my people.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the same time, however, I appreciate the attention to my needs. The only time she asks what she can help with is when I actually need help with something, and I'm not sure how she cues into it so well. Maybe following me around all day trained her intuition?
            </p>
            <p>
              She's not just helpful though... Raiden's always smiling and saying nice things to me, and it makes me feel so...relaxed? That isn't the word. I mean, she's always been this way, and I've always felt comforted by her, even when I'm annoyed. And she's really quite strong and skillful, too...
            </p>
            <p>
              Well, I really don't have the time to think about this! Not with all of my responsibilities, anyway.
