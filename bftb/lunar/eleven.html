              I've been talking with Raiden a lot in between church visits - one time she told me that she felt something too when we were at the meadow. The two of us think perhaps she was able to do something (not entirely certain what) to give me the ability to use my aspect. I asked if she could do it again, but she apparently has no idea how it happened. This is getting frustrating.
            </p>

              I wonder if she thinks this is funny. Maybe I should go get attacked by monsters again so she'll take me seriously. Sure, it's cruel, but it's far more cruel of her to see me go through all of this and not do anything for me. Didn't she promise she'd do everything she could? I'm looking at her right now, and she's just standing by my door doing NOTHING. I mean, you'd think that after I was told that I'd been CURSED, there would be a sense of urgency to do something about it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whatever, I'm going to get her to take me to the market again. The traveling book cart restocked, so I want to see what they have now. After that, it's back to the church.
