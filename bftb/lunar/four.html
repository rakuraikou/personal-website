              The Windknights brought someone to the castle yesterday, she's a girl like me and we're the same age (I think). My father tells me she is all by herself and the Windknights are looking for her family. I hope they can find them soon because she's really nice!! She says her name is Raiden, but she doesn't know anything else about herself. That's so weird??
            </p>
            <p>
              My father says that as long as it doesn't get in the way of church visits and training, I can talk with Raiden. He says that Lady Catherine said that the most important thing is growing closer with Loni. I think he's right. Going to the church is a lot of work, but it will make me very strong when I grow up!! I'm the princess after all!!

              Also, I have been spending a lot of time with Roga. She has been taking me to the market after training to buy books. I like to read big adventure books!!! Roga says that she'll buy for whatever I want to read, isn't that so sweet?? Raiden comes along sometimes too, but she's not really interested in books. She does help carry them which is so nice!
