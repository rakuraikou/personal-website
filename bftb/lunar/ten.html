              I can't believe what happened today.
            </p>
            <p>
              Raiden and I were headed home from a special visit to the Church of Loni, and we decided to stop at our usual afternoon spot - the dip in the meadow by the lua magnolia tree. Little did we know, there was a terrifying beast prowling the area, and it attacked us on sight! Raiden was struggling to fight it off, and I was hesitant to help (I didn't want to make anything worse since I can't really use magic), but then Raiden told me to stop being so scared... I'm still processing what she said to me exactly, but it was really kind, and I felt so strong after she said it. And then, guess what? I was able to cast a really powerful moon aspect spell! We sent that not-so-mighty beast running!
            </p>
            <p>
              After we got home, we told my father what had happened, and he was so surprised (in a good way). None of us had any idea how it happened, but now I'm really inspired to train even harder! Raiden says she'll continue to do her best for me too as my attendant.
