              Okay, well, <a href="https://toyhou.se/~literature/185143.bolt-from-the-blue-lits/3.end-of-summer/">big news</a>. Raiden and I may have kissed...!
            </p>
            <p>
              Honestly, it all happened so fast, and I get awfully flustered thinking about it. Though... It was a bit magical. It's like she knew what I wanted, and she was eager to give it to me. I pray the Champions' ears are not near, I'm so embarrassed! But it was nice...
            </p>
            <p>
              I really do like Raiden. She is so kind to me, even when I make mistakes or push her away. And she's always finding new ways to help not just me, but everyone else at the castle. I really admire her, and I wish I could learn more about her, though I suppose there isn't too much to learn from someone with amnesia... Regardless, I hope she's been having a good time in the castle.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wonder if she feels the same way I do - if she is... fond of me...like that. I'd ask her but, well, it's really too much to ask, isn't it? I'd be putting myself out there, and for what? I'm perfectly content with the current state of our relationship anyway. It would be nice if she knew how I felt, though. And if she felt the same way, I'd want to know too...
