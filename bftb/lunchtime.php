            Lunchtime
          </h1>
          <hr>
          <p>
            Lunchtime (also known as Raiceli) is the pairing between Raiden and Araceli from <i>Bolt from the Blue</i>. Lunchtime also happens to occupy my brain 24/7. The entire OCverse/story came from wanting to make a pair of fantasy lesbians, thus making Lunchtime as a ship the very first BFTB-related concept!
          </p>
          <p>
            The dynamic takes inspiration from princess/knight pairings, stories of love transcending metaphysical barriers (time/space/humanity) and/or love conquering all, and uhm...the trope of clearly high-class ladies falling for Some Guy...IT'S ENDEARING... In other words, Lunchtime is like if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravely_Default" target="_blank">Tiznes</a> (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravely_Default_II" target="_blank">Seth/Gloria</a>) was also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda" target="_blank">ZeLink</a> was also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Clover" target="_blank">Astelle</a> was also lesbian. In other, other words, it's my self indulgent ship that accidentally birthed a big worldbuilding/gamedev project.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <p>
            It all started ten years ago when Raiden mysteriously washed onto Umisuan shores. Despite not being able to recall anything but her own name, the Cielisono Royal Family took her in and cared for her, following a prior divination that stated that Raiden would become "important to the princess' prophecy." Soon after being taken in, Raiden was trained as a Windknight and took up the role as the princess' shadow. At first, young Araceli was excited to have someone her age in the Castle. Raiden was also happy to spend time with Araceli, and she was thankful to her family for her taking her in.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Araceli grew into her teen years, she became closed-off and jaded with her situation (tl;dr, she can't use magic, which is the one thing she <i>really</i> needs to be able to use right now in order to fulfill a kingdom-saving prophecy). She would inadvertently become irritable towards Raiden, since they were always together. After a horrific incident that resulted in permanent nerve damage to Araceli's right hand, Araceli made a strong attempt to lock away her emotions and focus entirely on the prophecy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Raiden, on the other hand, wanted to see Araceli happy. Whenever she saw Araceli fall to frustration and hopelessness, she would try to do something nice for her to uplift her (like take her to a nice restaurant). Sometimes, Araceli would lean into the quiet peace of being with Raiden, but she wouldn't let herself forget the prophecy looming over her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, the two are on a long journey together (with some others, but they don't matter right now). Though the path ahead is dangerous and unfamiliar, Raiden and Araceli find comfort and confidence in each other—as long as they have the other, everything will be alright.
          </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 0">Raiden</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                A friendly amnesiac who was brought into Castle Cieliso by the Rey. Raiden spent her "new life" with Araceli, serving as her primary knight-attendant (in official terms, her "shadow"). It's clear to everyone that she goes above and beyond in her role, but she interprets it as exemplary commitment to her duties. Any affections and fondness from the princess are also received similarly—Raiden just sees this as how the princess expresses appreciation. If asked, Raiden wouldn't be opposed to dating Araceli—in fact, she'd be quite eager! However, she would feel the need to resign from her position first, just to keep things professional (even if their lives and interactions would remain largely the same).
              </p>
              <p>
                As the princess' shadow, Raiden is very familiar with everything about Araceli, including the more flawed or unseemly qualities that Araceli doesn't reveal to others. Raiden loves and wants to protect all of it.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <div style="text-align: center">

                <h3 style="margin-top: 0">Araceli</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                A rather composed princess who's serious about seeing her ambitions to the end. Unfortunately her composure seems to waver when she's alone with her shadow, Raiden. It's not common for a Cielisona heiress and her shadow to be so close in age, so their relationship felt more like a childhood friendship than a royal arrangement. Araceli has an enormous crush on Raiden, though she'll deny it if anyone asks. Part of her hopes that Raiden will notice and admit that she shares the same feelings for her, but the very thought of Raiden confessing her love flusters her beyond function. Until then, Araceli is perfectly open to seeing other women casually until she and Raiden (certainly) get together one day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Araceli strongly values Raiden's loyalty and commitment. She believes that Raiden is someone she can always rely on, especially when Araceli feels broken. As long as Raiden is with her, Araceli feels like she can do anything.

          <h2>Why is it called "Lunchtime?"</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            The ship name was originally called Raiceli (RaiCeli). I said it out loud in a voice chat once and realized it sounded like rice-celi. Then the joke went on and it became rice-celery... Food... Lunchtime... 
          </p>
          <p>
            The other reason is because I think it's cute. And I love to eat lunch.

            This gallery hasn't been updated since like January 2025, and I've been too lazy to update it since. I plan on reworking it to only include some of my favorite Lunchtime artwork, since I have way too much for this website, so please stay tuned for that! In the meantime... Art has been categorized by origin and organized in reverse-chronological order (to the best of my ability). Enjoy!
