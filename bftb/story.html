              Embark on a magical journey where the strength of one's bonds has the power to overcome even prophecy. <i>Bolt from the Blue</i> follows the story of Araceli Almador de Luna, princess of a kingdom that's just been brought to ruin by a powerful, dark entity—one that she was destined to stop, but couldn't due to a curse that's plagued her for her entire life. Araceli's story is shown through the perspective of Raiden, her kind attendant ("shadow") with no recollection of her own past, who devotes herself entirely to Araceli's safety and well-being. Little do they know, the destruction has spread far beyond their home.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
              Accompanied by the ever-ambitious scion Saffron and the boisterous pirate Cole, the duo set out on a quest to lift Araceli's curse and return home—hopefully not too late for Araceli to fulfill her destiny as her kingdom's hero. At every turn, the party is threatened Nox Noctis, a mysterious organization seeking to seize control of mythical powers from Luxos' ancient past. Together, these four will put a stop to Nox Noctis' plans and bring light to a world succumbed to darkness.

                It's been six whole years since Raiden washed up in Bura Bay with nothing to her name, aside from her name itself. By some divine stroke of fate, she was taken in by the Cielisono Royal Family and has been serving as the princess' shadow, a role which entails more than enough knight-attendant duties to keep her busy. Though quiet, Raiden is extremely gentle and kind, inadvertently drawing people towards herself.

                Princess of the Cielisono Royal Family and future ruler of its kingdom, Araceli spent most of her time studying under an Arcanican tutor, training with the Windknights in magic and swordplay, and trying to hone her pact with the Champion Loniles. To the rest of the world, Araceli was the picture-perfect heiress for the kingdom. Behind all of that façade, however, was a young girl cursed to fail everyone.

However, as detached from fate as a member of House Infiaco could be, Saffron refuses to take this as an answer, embarking on a quest to make everyone listen to him.
