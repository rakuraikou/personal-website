            <i>Bolt from the Blue</i> is a worldbuilding and RPG gamedev project that I (<a href="/abt">LEN</a>) am developing. It centers around Araceli Almador de Luna and her journey to unlock the power to save her kingdom (and the world). The story heavily leans into themes of love as a transitive/reciprocative force, finding one's strength in others/bonds, and about saving a kind world.

            In December 2020, I started working on <i>Bolt from the Blue</i> with the purpose of making a world with everything I wanted in it. Now, it's my passion project and one of the main sources of comfort and joy in my life.
