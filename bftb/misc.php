        Inspirations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Behind every "very bad but very good" RPG is an "even worse but even better" RPG.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Bolt from the Blue</i> is meant to emulate the untitled subgenre of JRPGs that try to be both "modern" (by flipping the JRPG formula mechanically/narratively) and "classic" (to appeal to golden age nostalgia). The result is something terribly delicious and time-sinking. Other/more specific media inspirations include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Bravely series (esp. Bravely Default: Flying Fairy)
        </li>
        <li>
          Voice of Cards series (esp. The Forsaken Maiden)
        </li>
        <li>
          The Legend of Zelda series (esp. WW/BOTW/TOTK)
        </li>
        <li>
          Kingdom Hearts
        </li>
        <li>
          Octopath Traveler
        </li>
        <li>
          Genshin Impact
        </li>
        <li>
          Various shounen (esp. Black Clover, Naruto)
