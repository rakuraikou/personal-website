							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader">The Leader</a>: Araceli, defined by her determination. The game's main narrative is centered around her journey to obtain the power to recover her kingdom.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">The Smart Guy</a>: Saffron, to everyone else's detriment. Also <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBabyOfTheBunch">the Baby of the Bunch</a>, to his own detriment.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">The Big Guy</a>: Cole, thanks to having the highest DEF and second highest STR in the initial party. Also happens to be the <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamChef">Team Chef</a>.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>: There's a little bit of friction at first, but the main four characters grow to trust each other deeply and even hold together <span class="spoiler">after one is revealed to be a traitor</span>.

				<!--raiden description-->
				<p>
					A mysterious girl who washed up on the shores of Buragee just several years before the attack on Castle Cieliso, and the <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist">Supporting Protagonist</a> of <i>Bolt from the Blue</i>. Devoid of any memories of her past, she serves as Araceli's personal attendant—aka "shadow"—where she happily satisfies all of the princess' whims. Optimistic and friendly, Raiden is tries to lend a helping hand to anyone in need, <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">believing wholeheartedly in the strength of being kind</a>.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<!--raiden tropes-->
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">All-Loving Hero</a>: Raiden has a lot of patience with others and a great capacity to forgive. She is willing to go out of her way to help others, even complete strangers.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApologisesALot">Apologises a Lot</a>: Habitually apologizes if she feels like she's offended someone. It's a pretty big deal when she <i>doesn't</i> do this in the introduction of the game where she forces Araceli to flee San Ven.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>: Died after falling into an abyss, but was brought back <span class="spoiler">with Fenrir's power.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirthmarkOfDestiny">Birthmark of Destiny</a>: Unique diamond-shaped markings are present on Raiden's back, shoulders, wrists, waist and heels. <span class="spoiler">They are indicative of her connection to Fenrir.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a>: Though Castle Cieliso has graciously given her a basic education, she's clearly outsmarted by most other characters in the story.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenZero">The Chosen Zero</a>: One would assume that because Raiden was brought back to life <span class="spoiler">in "becoming" Fenrir</span>, she somehow earned that miracle. The reality is she didn't do anything special. She's a total nobody, especially compared to her friends.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">Chronic Hero Syndrome</a>: She's drawn towards righting every wrong she happens to stumble upon in her journey through Luxos—that is, until it conflicts with <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeclarationOfProtection">her duty</a> towards the princess.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeclarationOfProtection">Declaration of Protection</a>: By combination of oath and codependency issues.
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							"It is my sworn duty to protect the lone heiress to the San Ven throne. I shall be her shield. I shall carry her through malady and darkness. I shall hold her life above even my own. My commitment to her must never falter."
						</li>
					</ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperatelyNeedsOrders">Desperately Needs Orders</a>: Raiden more or less acts on Araceli's whims and will, rarely ever doing anything for her own reasons.
						<ul>
							<li>
								This trope is further emphasized by Raiden being the player perspective character—in a way, the player is also "giving orders" to her.
							</li>
							<li>
								Narratively, Raiden steps away from this mindset when the player begins completing the optional Link Quests. <span class="spoiler">Completing all of these is how the game's <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingOffTheBranches?from=Main.CanonEnding">Canon Ending</a> is triggered.</span>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyImpressed">Easily Impressed</a>: Blown away by just about everything new that she sees (which is... everything, <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">technically</a>).
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">Extreme Doormat</a>: Raiden avoids speaking up for herself, instead just going along with whatever others say or wish of her.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFool">The Fool</a>: Without her memories, Raiden seems pretty naive and aimless. For most of the story, her entire reason for sticking around is because <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyAndKnight">she swore to never leave Araceli's side</a>, but it's <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood">thanks to her kindness that everything works out in the end.</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealerSignsOnEarly">Healer Signs On Early</a>: The first character the player gets to use in battle, and she comes with a basic single-target healing skill.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSOD</a>: Particularly when Raiden learns that <span class="spoiler">she is Fenrir, and <i>that's</i> why Nox Noctis is targeting her (and wreaking so much havoc in the process). It troubles her quite deeply, but <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmWhatIAm">she gets over it</a>.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdentityAmnesia">Identity Amnesia</a>: Washes up with zero sense of self, and the identity she develops over the next several years is constructed entirely around Araceli and her family. She never regains her memories from before.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyAndKnight">Lady and Knight</a>: The knight to Araceli's lady. Raiden is technically enlisted in the Windknights, and part of her duty is protecting Araceli from danger (<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardingABadass">though Araceli herself is also combat-trained</a>).
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineOfSightName">Line-of-Sight Name</a>: Though her whole schtick is she "had nothing to offer the royal family but [her] name," it's not actually clear if "Raiden" is her real name or something that popped into her head when asked.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero">Magnetic Hero</a>: Has a naturally ability to connect with others, which results in those people either joining the party's adventure or lending a hand to Raiden in some other way.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>: She's literally the nicest character in <i>Bolt from the Blue</i>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName">Only One Name</a>: Raiden doesn't have a last name.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">Person of Mass Destruction</a>: <span class="spoiler">She's Fenrir, a "Beastlord" that's more commonly referred to as "The Luminescent Devourer." This title isn't without reason—Fenrir literally consumes light, the energy force of everything in the world.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">Shock and Awe</a>: Raiden has a lightning aspect.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StevenUlyssesPerhero">Steven Ulysses Perhero</a>: The name "Raiden" means god of lightning.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a>: Link State, a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarkedChange">transformed state</a> in which Raiden takes on the aspect of someone who she's previously <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">"linked"</a> with in the story. Comes with a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerGlows">visible aura</a> and <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem">a swapped set of abilities</a> that resemble the target aspect/wielder.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockShonenHero">Stock Shōnen Hero</a>: A pretty snug fit for this trope. Raiden is kindhearted, simple-minded, and has a unique and powerful ability. Her entire philosphy is rooted in <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a> and she has a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShonenHair">Shonen Hairstyle</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictorGainsLosersPowers">Victor Gains Loser's Powers</a>: Some Link Quests are completed by having Raiden defeat the relevant character in battle. Completing any Link Quest unlocks a new Link State, a unique ability that Raiden can use. This ability allows her to use new powers in combat based on the relevant character.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson">The Watson</a>: <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Conveniently has very little sense of how the world of Luxos operates or what societies lie within it</a>. The other three party members take their own respective roles in explaining it all to her.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWakeUpOnABeach">You Wake Up on a Beach</a>: Her earliest memory is washing up on the coast.
					</li>

				<p>The <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">Protagonist</a> of <i>Bolt from the Blue</i>, Araceli is a princess <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">fated to be the savior against a grand, dark force</a>. Shortly after she was born, however, <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenPrincess">something akin to a curse severely disables her aspect,</a> and she's unable to tap into her true power and fight back when the prophesied dark force threatens her home. With no choice but to flee with her shadow, Araceli is set on returning with the power to take back her kingdom.</p>
				<hr>
				<!--araceli tropes-->
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">Because Destiny Says So</a>: Ever since childhood, Araceli has devoted much of her time and energy towards trying to unlock her promised power, even going so far as to sacrifice other interests and relationships. She claims that all of this is in the name of satisfying the prophecy imposed on her.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTics">Character Tics</a>: Bites her thumb or knuckle when anxious or lost in thought.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a>: Subverted. As fated by a reading by Lady Infiaco (and various ancient texts), Araceli was supposed to be the key to stopping a ruinous attack on Castle Cieliso. Unfortunately, she could not unlock the ability to overcome the opposing force, leading to the downfall of her kingdom. <span class="spoiler">Double Subverted when she does return to Cieliso at the game's climax and faces the assailants head-on (and comes out victorious).</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConfidant">The Confidant</a>: She is the first person who Cole confides to about what happened to The Four Skulls, as well as her guilt regarding the matter. <span class="spoiler">However, Cole carefully omits her affiliation with Nox Noctis...</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenPrincess">Fallen Princess</a>: The perfect heir, aside from that whole curse thing, which ultimately results in the fall of her kingdom.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">My Greatest Failure</a>: Failing to fulfill a prophecy to save Cieliso from ruin, even though it's literally not her fault.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyAndKnight">Lady and Knight</a>: The lady to Raiden's knight. Raiden's role is less of a protective knight and more of a personal escort/servant, but Araceli seems to appreciate that plenty.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader">The Leader</a>: Of the headstrong flavor. Araceli's determination to return home and fulfill the prophecy laid out for her (combined with Raiden's <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">Chronic Hero Syndrome</a>, for better or worse) is what gets the main party swept into all kinds of adventures and errands. <span class="spoiler">Araceli's status as the leader is further reinforced with the "final" chapter of the game beginning with a return to Cieliso.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeFatherLikeSon">Like Father, Like Daughter</a>: Araceli valuing the fate of her kingdom to a deep, martyr-like level comes directly from her dad's influence and guidance.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightEmUp">Light 'em Up</a>: Araceli has a radiance aspect.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Power Incontinence</a>: Inverted. Her aspect is actually <i>blocked</i>, and Araceli requires significant workarounds (and incurs damaging consequences) to make any use of it.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTattoo">Power Tattoo</a>: A symbol of the Champion Loniles glows on her hand when she (tries) to use her aspect.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyPrincessPowerhouse">Pretty Princess Powerhouse</a>: Extremely adept at swordfighting, even against multiple opponents at once. She also has better offensive stats than her literal bodyguard, Raiden.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood">Royal Blood</a>: Cielisono Royal Family.

					The second-born son of House Infiaco, Saffron is a scholarly noble who believes that he should inherit the House instead of his older brother (who is actually rather competent, mind you), seeking out every shred of reason and proof to present to his family. He reluctantly partners with the pirate Cole on a voyage to Cieliso for trivial discussions over paperwork and to <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends">meet with its princess, Araceli</a>. However, his personal quest is suddenly thrown into chaos by the attack on San Ven.

					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBabyOfTheBunch">The Baby of the Bunch</a>: Saffron is the youngest of the main four. He's occasionally teased about this by the oldest of the group, Cole, despite only being a few years younger than her</span>.

						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaQueen">Drama Queen</a>: Played for laughs. He's just a spoiled noble who's way out of touch with reality.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireIsRed">Fire is Red</a>: Subverted. The Infiaco family's fire aspect wielders channel golden flames.

						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessSuitor">Hopeless Suitor</a>: Had a decade-long crush on Araceli, who did not reciprocate. <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation">Turns out she's just not into guys.</a>

					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex">Inferiority Superiority Complex</a>: He's not quiet about his accolades and abilities in the slightest.

						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyNameIsInigoMontoya">My Name is Inigo Montoya</a>: In several confrontations (the most notable—and ironic, since they are established to already know each other—instance being with <span class="spoiler">Karma</span>) he introduces himself with his full title.

Even if he's preparing meals with someone who <i>can</i> cook (i.e. Cole), he will very strongly insist on <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CordonBleughChef">adding bizarre ingredients and seasonings to "improve taste"</a>.

							Each noble house of Pyrus has a special power inherited by its members: for House Infiaco, this power is future sight. The potency at which members of the bloodline can use this ability varies—Saffron unfortunately is on <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">the less impressive end of this spectrum</a>, only able to vaguely perceive events within the next day (whereas his mother can clearly see up to a year <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelestialDeadline">on a good day</a>).

					Formerly first mate of the infamous sky pirates crew, The Four Skulls, Cole leaves her powerful position after a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">dark tragedy</a> and resides <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWorkAlone">alone</a> in her own skycraft. After solo pirating for a few years, she uncharacteristically takes a job from the Pyrusian noble Saffron and welcomes aboard a couple of stowaways on the run from the attack on San Ven. Intially, Cole only intended to bring them back home and be on her way, but she has secretly grown fond of the idea of a new crew, amusedly tagging along with their antics.

						</li>
					</ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWorkAlone">I Work Alone</a>: After leaving The Four Skulls, but prior to meeting the rest of the party, Cole continued pirate activity under a solo title. Notoriety of her solo work spread quickly, earning her a reputation of a cold-hearted loner.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue">Lovable Rogue</a>: Commits petty crimes around San Ven and the Skysea Port, but her tough/cool nature and sense of humor earns her enough charm to get by without arrest.

					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalVillain">Nominal Villain</a>: Not necessarily a bad person at heart, but <span class="spoiler">works for Nox Noctis in exchange for information about her lost ex-captain.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname">Only Known by Their Nickname</a>: Nobody in the story calls her by her birth name, Colwyn. Most characters refer to her as Cole, with the exceptions being Saffron (who calls her some variation of "[insult] pirate") and those from The Four Skulls (who refer to her by her last name, "Fulrisk").

					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegretfulTraitor">Regretful Traitor</a>: <span class="spoiler">Turns out to be a lackey for Nox Noctis, simply completing the task of bringing Raiden into their hands. At the beginning of this story, going forward with this doesn't bother her in the slightest, having closed herself off from emotions and intimacy. However, after going on an entire adventure with the group, she grows increasingly guilty about the whole thing, leading to her ultimate <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel-Face Turn</a>.</span>

					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuggedScar">Rugged Scars</a>: Has a few scars from some dangerous encounters—a couple running down from her left cheek past her neck and one on her right upper arm. She also has a caelism bruise (a magic scar, basically) on her right wrist, and a couple of notches in her right wing.

					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkyPirate">Sky Pirate</a>: She's a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pirate">pirate</a> and she has a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAirship">skycraft</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarAndIcePersonality">Sugar and Ice Personality</a>: Cole typically sticks to herself, presenting as an aloof lone wolf. Joining or forming a new crew was the last thing any pirate peers would have ever expected. However, depsite still trying to maintain this reputation, Cole is awfully caring and warmhearted towards Raiden, Araceli and Saffron.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamChef">Team Chef</a>: Raised in Sinocrast by two masterful chefs, Cole <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupremeChef">naturally picked up a knack or two for cooking</a>. She prepares most of the meals for the party, with one of the other three occasionally offering to substitute for a night.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicIceCharacter">Tragic Ice Character</a>: Wrought with coldness and tragedy, Cole <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">ice-olates</a> hardcore (and hates that lifestyle, deep down).

						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush">Bodyguard Crush</a>: Currently hired as Coco's escort and bodyguard. Coco's feelings for Kanten are very obvious, but Kanten's remained professional.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardingABadass">Bodyguarding a Badass</a>: Coco is perfectly capable of handling herself, but prefers leaning on Kanten because it's both convenient and "romantic."
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnigmaticMinion">Enigmatic Minion</a>: Clearly aligned with Nox Noctis, but doesn't particularly care for its goals or methods. Though it's clear she's only aligned with them as a commissioned mercenary, she seems to have some secret motivations underneath.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryScarHasAStory">Every Scar Has a Story</a>: The one on her right eyelid came from a particularly nasty client from Kanten's past.

						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyesAlwaysShut">Eyes Always Shut</a>: Kanten's eyes are almost always closed, only open when she is using <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomainHolder">Whirlwind</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">Only in It for the Money</a>: A very picky mercenary who only takes jobs she deems "worth their price." She actually stops pursuing Raiden on behalf of Nox Noctis because she's resolved that <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInMyContract">the effort has begun to outweigh the payment</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller">Professional Killer</a>: Her main gig as a mercenary.
