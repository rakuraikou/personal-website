          Link State (stylized as Link State) is a special ability exclusive to Raiden. Each type, known as a Link, is obtained as a reward for completing another character's Link Quest. When active, Raiden's aspect changes, and she receives a unique set of CAST skills to use in battle based on the respective character's own strengths. Additionally, if the character that the Link State originates from is also in the party, that character is then able to use a special combo CAST skill with Raiden.
        </p>
        <p>
          While being able to switch aspects and roles on the fly is powerful, Link State comes with a plethora of conditions and drawbacks. Raiden's Link meter is drained every time Link State is activated or a Link CAST skill is used. Additionally, activating a Link State slightly damages all other characters in the party (except for the character in the "on deck" position).

        <p>
          Raiden's Link meter grows when Raiden heals or cures another ally.

        <p class="notebox">
          There are a total of 18 Links that can be obtained in <i>Bolt from the Blue.</i> Raiden's, of course, is unlocked from the very start of the game.
