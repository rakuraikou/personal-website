          People in Luxos share the same biological foundations. They are humanoid and bipedal, and may have a pair of horns or a tail. While some may bear wings or gills, flight and underwater breathing is not possible without magic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like all other things, people are composed of "<a href="light">light</a>." It is entwined with their molecular structure, and commands life, growth and <a href="magic">magic</a>. As long as light is present, a great number of both physical and magical attacks can be endured before serious or lasting conditions occur. The recovery of injuries is carried out by the light within one's body drawing in untethered "pure" light that permeates the atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every person in Luxos has a heart. This is what makes living beings (not just people) "alive"—as long as it is present and beating, light will remain affixed to the body and flow through it. It also keeps one's light from being used by others for casting, and what allows someone to cast magic themself.
        </p>
        <p>
          When someone dies, their heart ceases to function, and any light in their body will wash into the atmosphere, leaving behind an empty corpse. Should someone's memory and legacy be held onto by enough people, that person may become a <a href="champions">Champion</a>, and their intact light will persist onward.

        </h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Though not formal organizations, there are certain classes of people recognized through particular status or culture. These terms and roles attached to them are considered common knowledge in Luxos, but their reputations vary.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Adventurers
        </h3>
        <p>
          The vastness of Luxos piques the curiosity of many brave ones. Those that act upon their courage and venture across the realm are known as "adventurers." Not every adventurer is a quest-stamping, dragon-slaying legend, but their stories are the loudest—thus, they are the stereotype. That being said, many adventurers pursue a specific mission or niche, such as treasure hunters looking to make big relic money, researchers digging for the unknown, or medical doctors providing their services as they pass through.
        </p>
        <p>
          In recent years, pursuing an adventuring career has become rather popular, and several locales have been shaped by this growing trend. For example, many treasure-hunting adventurers make sure to visit Deep Umisuu's ruins. Because of its proximity to Deep Umisuu's coast, Bura Bay is a common spot for these adventurers to rest, with many of its amenities designed with them in mind. Sinkrast is an entire island in the middle of the Luxic Sea recognized as a popular checkpoint for those looking to cross the ocean. It's since grown into a culinary paradise where well-seasoned adventurers visit to expand their palate.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not easy to leave home and travel with such confidence, so most people tend to have some level of respect for adventurers. Popularity scales with strength or accolade—most "renown" ones being those with particularly heroic deeds under their belts. That being said, adventurers don't typically receive special treatment unless they're doing business in a town already geared towards them.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Pirates
        </h3>
        <p>
          Technically, pirates are groups or networks of adventurers with a common goal or trade in mind and (more importantly) zero alignment to the nation that they operate within. The term is used colloquially to refer to those that pursue or command territory (aka "turf") and is rarely used outside of that context, despite its generic definition. These pirates tend to be extremely competitive.
        </p>
        <p>
          While they don't legally own the area in which they operate, pirates with turf hold a certain authority over the people there. Oftentimes, this respect is commanded with fear, resulting in the rather negative perception among the general public. However, there are many pirates that exert very little force on the area they possess, and simply claim the area as means of strengthening reputation against other pirates. Some national authorities have pushed efforts towards keeping pirates away from their towns, but others truly don't care what happens to the more "inconsequential" territories. A few actually collude with pirates for mutual benefit.
        </p>
        <p class="notebox">
          Because of the loud reputation of pirates that claim turf, "pirate" is considered an insult when used outside of adventurer or pirate communities. It is an especially deep offense to someone of high status, such as a noble. Interestingly enough, there are accounts of individuals who have renounced their nobility to join a pirate's crew.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Nobility
        </h3>
        <p>
          While the term refers to anyone born into a family of affluent status in a given region, most people associate nobility with exceptional magical prowess—most noble families happen to have a strong tie with a Champion or have at least one <a href="beastlords">talisman</a> to their name. Noble families are present in every region, and their authority is typically reserved to the region in which they hail from.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noble families trace back to the original founders of the region, either through bloodline or association. An affiliation with a Champion that spans many generations is also common—members of a noble family may possess a special ability by virtue of this connection, regardless if they have a formal pact with the Champion themself.
        </p>
        <p class="notebox">
          Because of a strong connection to Buran of Perception, members of the Infiaco bloodline are granted precognitive abilities. However, the extent of this ability varies from person to person and is unaffected by pact status.
        </p>
        <p>
          A noble authority's response to pirates in their domain can vary. Most nobles will try to drive pirates out of their domain, particularly if they cause enough trouble for their citizens. However, some may allow pirate crews to stay and act as desired in exchange for something else, perhaps working together for some greater goal.
