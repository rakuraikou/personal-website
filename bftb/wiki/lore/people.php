        People in Luxos share the same biological foundations. They are humanoid and bipedal, and may have a pair of horns or a tail. Few possess the physiological features needed to fly or breathe underwater - those fortunate to be born with wings or gills require extensive physical training to utilize them without magic. Generally, these features are inherited, but ability or aptitude to make convenient use of them is not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like all other things, people are composed of "light." Also known as "life force" or "magical energy," light is constantly flowing, occassionally pooling in certain places. In the context of people, it is entwined with their molecular structure, and commands life, growth and magic. As long as light is present, a great number of both physical and magical attacks can be endured before serious or lasting conditions occur. The recovery of injuries is carried out by the light within one's body drawing in untethered light that permeates the atmosphere.

        Though not formal organizations, there are certain classes of people recognized through particular status or culture. These terms and roles attached to them are considered common knowledge in Luxos, but their reputations vary. Information about keepers and Champions can be found <a href="keepers.php">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Adventurers
      </h3>
      <p>
        The vastness of Luxos piques the curiosity of many brave ones. Those that act upon their courage and venture across the realm are known as "adventurers." Not every adventurer is a quest-stamping, dragon-slaying legend, but the stereotype is recognized rather widely despite this. That being said, many adventurers pursue a specific mission or niche, such as treasure hunters looking to make big relic money, researchers digging for the unknown, or medical doctors providing their services as they pass through.
      </p>
      <p>
        In recent years, pursuing an adventuring career has become rather popular, and several locales have been shaped by this growing trend. For example, many treasure-hunting adventurers make sure to visit Deep Umisuu's ruins. Because of its proximity to Deep Umisuu's coast, Buragee is a common spot for these adventurers to rest, with many of its amenities designed with them in mind. Sinocrast is an entire island in the middle of the Luxic Sea recognized as a popular checkpoint for those looking to cross the sea. It's since grown into a culinary paradise where well-seasoned adventurers visit to expand their palate.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not easy to leave home and travel with such confidence, so most people tend to have some level of respect for adventurers. Popularity scales with strength or accolade -  most "renown" ones were keepers or those with heroic deeds under their belts. That being said, most people don't give them any special treatment unless they're doing business in a town already geared towards adventurers.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Pirates
      </h3>
      <p>
        Technically, pirates are groups or networks of adventurers with a common goal or trade in mind and (more importantly) zero alignment to the nation that they operate wtihin (Cieliso, Umisuu, Pyrus or Guashan). The term is used colloquially to refer to those that pursue or command territory - aka "turf" - and is rarely used outside of that context, despite its generic definition. These pirates tend to be extremely competitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Turf-type pirates don't legally own the area in which they operate, but they hold a certain authority with the people there. Oftentimes, this respect is commanded with fear, resulting in pirates having a rather negative perception among citizens. However, there are many pirates that exert very little force on the area they possess, and simply claim the area as means of strengthening reputation against other pirates. Some national authorities have pushed efforts towards keeping pirates away from their towns, but others truly don't care what happens to the more "inconsequential" territories.
      </p>
      <p class="notebox">
        Because of the loud reputation of pirates that claim turf, "pirate" is considered an insult when used outside of adventuring or pirate communities. It is an especially deep offense to someone of high status, such as a noble. Interestingly enough, there are accounts of individuals who have renounced their nobility to join a pirate's crew.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Nobility
      </h3>
      <p>
        While the term refers to anyone born into a family of affluent status in a given region, most people associate nobility with exceptional magical prowess. This association is not without grounding, as most noble families happen to have a strong tie with a Champion or possess at least one talisman. Noble families are present in every region, and their authority is typically reserved to the region in which they hail from.
      </p>
      <p>
        Noble families trace back to the original founders of the region, either through bloodline or association. An affiliation with a Champion that spans many generations is also common - members of a noble family may possess a special ability by virtue of this connection, regardless if they have a formal pact with the Champion themself.
      </p>
      <p class="notebox">
        Because of a strong connection to Buran of Perception, members of the Infiaco bloodline are granted precognitive abilities. However, the extent of this ability varies from person to person and is unaffected by pact status.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nobility response to pirates in their domain vary. Most nobles will try to drive pirates out of their domain, particularly if they cause enough trouble for their citizens. However, some may allow pirate crews to stay and act as desired in exchange for something else, perhaps colluding for some greater goal.
