      <h1>
        Keepers
      </h1>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Linked from birth, keepers are people with a special "bond" to their respective Beastlords. This bond allows them access to their Beastlord's "thoughts," as well as potential to utilize all three of its governed aspects. The main duty of a Keeper is to facilitate communication between the people and their linked Beastlord. The way this responsibility manifests varies between relationships, but generally pertains to the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Delivering messages between the Beastlord and region's people
        </li>
        <li>
          Rituals to sate/appease the Beastlord
        </li>
        <li>
          Helping out townspeople and investigating dangerous requests ("Hometown Hero" tasks)
        </li>
        <li>
          Warning people of certain (otherwise unexpected) events caused by the Beastlord
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Technically, keepers don't <i>need</i> to do anything. Their connection to their Beastlord and the extra magic power isn't inherently tied to the effort (or lack thereof) put into maintaining the connection. However, a negligent Keeper may find that a displeased or unmonitored Beastlord can unleash catastrophe on the world and the people who inhabit it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personal attitudes towards this involuntary responsibility vary, but most keepers seem to enjoy the role and the sense of heroic purpose it implies. By default, most keepers have a positive reputation with the community thanks to both their duties and their power.

      <h2>
        Champions
      </h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        When a keeper dies, another is born (or, in rare cases, chosen) immediately after. If enough people hold a late keeper's legacy in high regards, then they can offer their light to preserve that keeper's own existence. Keepers who persist after death in this way are considered divine beings and referred to as "Champions." Champions can act completely on their own whim and desire, but can only exist in and interact with Luxos with consistent, voluntary offerings of light. It's common for Champions to grant natural miracles - such as sparks to provide flame on a cold night or richer soils for a fruitful harvest - in exchange for offerings. Though they don't have a permanent physical state of their own, Champions can temporarily manifest in areas where substantial amounts of light have been collected.
      </p>
      <p>
        A person can decide to give a small portion of their light to a Champion at any given point in their life. This act yields similar effects to using an aspect - specifically, the individual making the sacrifice accumulates cael. Because of the strain one risks by offering light, most people only go out of their way to offer light a couple times in their lives or for specific occasions (if ever).
      </p>
      <p class="notebox">
        Sometimes, people will "swear" to a Champion (e.g. "Loni of Tenacity," "do the Ignited Eyes deceive me?"). This language is usually specific to a particular region or culture, and is considered a telltale way to recognize where someone may be from.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Pacts
      </h3>
      <p>
        In order to guarantee a more consistent flow of light offerings, Champions can form pacts with people on Luxos. The basic structure of a pact is between one Champion and one acolyte (person) - the Champion receives regular offerings of light and a point to manifest (i.e. speaking/acting through the acolyte), and the acolyte gains access to some of the Champion's power. Like keepers, acolytes are also well-respected in society for their clear devotion to their pacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are strict conditions and guidelines to follow with a pact, and failure to keep one's end of the bargain results in immediate, dramatic consequence. These guidelines are consistent across pacts, but the details may vary slightly depending on the individuals involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        In every arrangement, the acolyte's aspect must be the same as one of the Champion's. Between the Champion and acolyte, a specific "routine" for light offering is agreed upon (i.e. how much light, and how often it is offered). This practice is generally done in private and cannot be "rescheduled" once established. The light-drawing procedure itself renders the acolyte temporarily immobile and unaware of their surroundings. The amount of light offered shouldn't pose a risk for caelism for the acolyte - though it may cause fatigue or weakness, the process is otherwise painless. However, it is important to note that there have been instances of careless acolytes accumulating a significant amount of cael prior to a light-drawing session who end up quite ill after the procedure.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Breaking a Pact
      </h3>
      <p>
        Pacts between a Champion and an acolyte are broken through breach of the agreement. Because the pact is built upon mutualistic terms, it's not common to see one broken by either party. However, it's not entirely out of the realm of reason to break one. In most cases of this rare occurrence, a pact falls apart if one side perceives the pact as becoming unfair or unmanageable. For example, an acolyte may have had a significant lifestyle change that hinders their ability continue offering light. A Champion may feel like their power is being misused by the acolyte, and wish to sever ties before their reputation is further tarnished. Other reasons include no longer seeing the pact as beneficial or a sufficient enough means of power, or simply disliking the other party.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, there's no clean or painless way to break a pact. One individual must make the call, and that individual alone must suffer the consequences, even if it was a mutual agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Champion is the one to break the pact, a piece of the Champion's power remains in the ex-acolyte in the form of light. Though they only possess a small portion of power compared to what was once available during the pact's intact state, ex-acolytes come out of the fracture notably stronger than the average person. On the other hand, the Champion comes out notably weaker due to a portion of their maximum reserve of light now within the ex-acolyte. If the Champion continues to form and sever pacts, eventually they won't be able to gather the light needed to sustain their existence, and will eventually fade permanently.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the acolyte is the one to break the pact, they will receive a visual anomaly similar in appearance and effect to caelism. Manifesting as a sooty, black-iridescent blight, these marks permanently weaken the body part of which they happen to appear on. A mark upon the palm may render the ex-acolyte unable to firmly grip objects; one around the eyes may incur a loss of sight or smell. Most Champions will avoid forming pacts with anyone who possesses these marks, as they are considered indicators of a potentially unreliable acolyte. Other people on Luxos generally feel intimidated or uneasy towards someone with a mark, though some may be worried or curious about its origins; it is not unlike how one would react to seeing someone with a severe wound or scar. Despite public perception, marks are not something that ex-acolytes are persecuted for, nor do they siginificantly affect their social standing.
