        People in Luxos share the same biological foundations. They are humanoid and bipedal, and may have a pair of horns or a tail. Few possess the physiological features needed to fly or breathe underwater - those fortunate to be born with wings or gills require extensive physical training to utilize them without magic. Generally, these features are inherited, but ability or aptitude to make convenient use of them is not.

        Additionally, people on Luxos are composed of "light." It's best to think of light as a force of energy, much like ki. It is constantly flowing, and occasionally pools in certain places. In the context of people, it is entwined with their molecular structure, and serves as the vector that commands life, growth and magic. As long as light is present, a great number of both physical and magical attacks can be endured before serious or lasting condition occurs. Any injury is gradually recovered by the light within one's body pulling in the untethered light that permeates the atmosphere.
