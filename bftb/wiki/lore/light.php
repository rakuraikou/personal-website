        Everything on Luxos is made of "light," a compound and force colloquially referred to as "life force" or "magical energy." Light is not only present in every entity and lifeform, but it also flows in a "pure" state in the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p class="notebox">
        Though it is constantly flowing, light will occasionally pool in certain places. For example, a dense cluster of light forms in South Pyrus once every ten years. Members of House Infiaco take advantage of this phenomenon by amplifying their precognitive abilities through this cluster, allowing them to see much further into the future.

        It's generally agreed upon that sentience is determined through if the entity in question can't be manipulated by an <a href="magic">aspect</a>. That being said, scholars aren't quite sure what exactly makes up sentient beings (particularly <a href="people">people</a>) aside from the nebulous "light."
