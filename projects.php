      <h2>Projects/Worlds</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 25px">I do stuff sometimes. It's a lot of fun! Except for when it isn't.</p>

      <h3>Original characters and stories</h3>
      <h4><a href="bftb/index">Bolt from the Blue</a></h4>
      <p>A worldbuilding/gamedev project started in December 2020 inspired by silly classic JRPGs about little guys going on big adventures. There's also a <a href="https://toyhou.se/charge/characters/folder:1796863" target="_blank">TOYHOU.SE folder</a> for this project that I'm currently working on.</p>

      <h4><a href="twps/index">The Witch-Patron Society</a></h4>
      <p>A collaborative OCverse I have with my friends. TWPS takes place in a nebulously-located but strictly-modern university setting and follows a group of losers banded under Osis, The Dark Overlord. Lot of funny stuff going on there, check out the <a href="https://toyhou.se/~world/159188.the-witch-patron-society">TOYHOU.SE world</a> while you're at it.</p>

      <h4><a href="dsa/index">DEEP SEA ARTSCAPE</a></h4>
      <p>Just a Discord server I spend way too much time polishing + managing (I say this lovingly. The people in there make it worth going this hard for). It's designed with OC/worldbuilding/projectdev in mind, so there's channels for people's projects, monthly events/prompts, etc. The site isn't updated, but the server is still running, so come hang out with us!</p>

      <h3>Fan characters and projects</h3>
      <h4><a href="bravelymarle">Bravely Marle</a></h4>
      <p>
        My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravely_Default">Bravely Default</a> fan OCs. They exist in the world of Luxendarc, but one that's a little more developed with concepts by my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/chuunicherry" target="_blank">Fio</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Other personal works</h3>
      <h4><a href="https://rakuraikou.itch.io/stardust-trinity-ltd">Stardust Trinity, LTD</a></h4>
      <p>
        A quick and dirty kinetic novel that my girlfriend and I put together in about a week for a game jam.
      </p>
      <h4><a href="cfb/index">Chalk For Bones</a></h4>
      <p>
        It's just a personal writing collection. Poetry, letters, prose... Whatever lols. Any necessary content warnings will be noted on the page itself.
