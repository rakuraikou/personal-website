      <h2>Stuff I'm working on!!</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 25px">Ideally I'll have subpages on this website for these, notably the non-BftB stuff (BftB is already being documented on Notion and I'm too lazy to crosspost). It's not the greatest priority in the world, though.</p>

      <h4><a href="bftb/index.html">Bolt from the Blue</a></h4>
      <p>Rotating in my head at a constant velocity is my silly worldbuilding/gamedev project. Inspired by silly classic JRPGs about little guys going on big adventures.</p>

      <h4><a href="mintyverse/index.html">Mintyverse</a></h4>
      <p>What was originally supposed to be a "break" from the heavy worldbuilding of BftB gradually became a bit of a reflection on my adolescence, weirdly enough. It's a really lame story about a chuuni determined to save the world from its inevitable end. I plan on turning this into a game as well, albeit a much smaller one than BftB. There's also a <a href="https://toyhou.se/charge/characters/folder:1608819" target="_blank">TOYHOU.SE folder</a> for this, but it's a giant WIP.</p>

      <h4>Deep Sea Artscape</h4>
      <p>Just a <a href="https://toyhou.se/~forums/10502.creator-s-corner/334120.deep-sea-artscape-art-oc-project-dev-server-" target="_blank">Discord server</a> I spend way too much time polishing + managing (I say this lovingly. The people in there make it worth going this hard for). It's designed with OC/worldbuilding/projectdev in mind, so there's channels for people's projects, monthly events/prompts, etc.</p>
