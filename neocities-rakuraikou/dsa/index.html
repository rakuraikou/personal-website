        What is Deep Sea Artscape?

            Deep Sea Artscape (DSA) is an art Discord server specifically centered around OC (original character) and original worldbuilding discussion. The server aims to create a fun and friendly sea-themed space to encourage creators to work on and share their projects, as well as bring together like-minded artists to talk about original characters and stories.

            I (Len) started DSA in February 2022 as a corner for some original character roleplay friends to hang out together after the roleplay group fizzled out. It's since grown into something much larger, and I feel like I'm very fortunate to run such an awesome community!
