      <h2>My Blind Box Figurine Collection</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 25px">I got into collecting blind box stuff in like 2022 because I wanted some cute little guys on my desk for cheap. I like the randomness of it (I also love Pokemon cards for this same reason, but I don't have a page for my cards lol). While I do own figurines that <i>aren't</i> from blind boxes, I won't be putting them on this page! I'm not sponsored by any of these guys, I just like spreading the joy.</p>

      <h3>
        Home Shiba
      </h3>
      <p>
        I got Home Shiba as an impulse purchase, and I really like how heavy they feel. These figurines were bigger than I expected, and I like the little accessories they come with.

      <h3>
        Nezha Seasonal Flowers
      </h3>
      <p>
        I wish I had more of these! I really love every item in this set, the details are really beautiful and the faces are too cute.

      <h3>
        Fei Ren Zai Manor Mystery
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is my favorite set right now. Each card has a backside (I did not take pics of them oops) with three hints to solve a mystery of some sort. I love the designs of the characters, and I got my dreamie on my first pull (Da Sheng basic) and the hidden on my second.

      <h3>
        Azura Animal Fighting Match Series
      </h3>
      <p>
        My maiden voyage into blind box figurine collecting, and also my largest collection right now. I got four of these girls, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of potential dupes LOL

        Sleep Sea Elves
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think these figurines are beautiful, but they seem so fragile... During one of my moves, a dot of red inexplicably appeared on my only figurine. Scary.
