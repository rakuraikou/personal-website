    <h2>Luxos, the realm of light</h2>
    The story of Bolt from the Blue takes place on Luxos, a world composed of four Great Regions. Prior to the current four-section layout, Luxos was simply split into Upper and Lower sections. Upper Luxos was made up of what is now known as Cieliso (as well as some regions of the Guashan Peaks), leaving Lower Luxos with Pyrus, most of Guashan, and what was present at the time in Umisuu before tides lowered. The current divisions of territory are a part of a political undertaking related to maintaining peace with the Beastlords.
