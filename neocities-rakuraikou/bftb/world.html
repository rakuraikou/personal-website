    <h2>Luxos, the realm of light</h2>
    <p>
      The story of Bolt from the Blue takes place on Luxos, a world composed of four Great Regions. Prior to the current four-section layout, Luxos was simply split into Upper and Lower sections. Upper Luxos was made up of what is now known as Cieliso (as well as some regions of the Guashan Peaks), leaving Lower Luxos with Pyrus, most of Guashan, and what was present at the time in Umisuu before tides lowered. The current divisions of territory are a part of a political undertaking related to maintaining peace with the Beastlords.

Highlighted in the central island lies the proud capital city of San Ven. Surrounding the capital are smaller, sovereign communities, with scattered terrestrial and arboreal natural habitats. A constant breeze cycles the region, and windstorms will occasionally pass through. In order to reduce damage to infrastructure, tunnels have been constructed inside and around the archipelago to redirect and disperse the powerful gusts. Travel between the islands and beyond the country is typically accomplished through the use of skycrafts.

        <h3>Government</h3>
        <p>
          Historically ruled by the Vientoluna line, Cieliso is currently overseen by Adelio and Amora. They are respectively referred to as the Rey and Reina by the people, and their roles have been set in stone since the beginning of the bloodline's rule - the Rey is to handle international affairs, while the Reina's duty is centered on domestic concerns. The Rey and Reina reside in Castle Cieliso alongside castle staff and other attendants, including (but not limited to): gardeners, chefs, guards, tutors, apothecaries, and personal assistants. Castle Cieliso is located in the heart of San Ven.
        </p>
        <p>
          The governing body of Cieliso doesn't tend to impose high regulation on its sovereign municipalities. However, they also don't offer much insurance or protection for them either, unless a significant threat by another nation is posed.
        </p>
        <h3>Economy</h3>
        <p>
          Cieliso's capital, San Ven, houses inarguably the largest general market in all of Luxos, making it a fantastic location for traders and tourists alike. Despite its large size, the Tradewinds Center is incredibly regulated, and each merchant must acquire a license to sell in the area, as well as be able to pay the monthly stand rental fee. The latter barrier often results in vendors pairing up, splitting the fee and running their respective businesses in rotations to save on costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those who would prefer not to set up shop in the Tradewinds Center for any reason, the Skysea is an open and significantly less regulated market. Located off the southeastern “coast” of Cieliso, the Skysea is more or less available to anyone with a Skycraft. Though slightly less popular than the Tradewinds Center, it still presents itself as a lucrative option - that is, if those who pursue it don't mind uninsured sky pirate encounters.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Climate
        </h3>
        <p>
          The annual climate pattern in Cieliso follows four distinct seasons, however the average temperature is notably cooler than most other areas in Luxos. The floating nation also has the highest annual precipitation, with heavy snowy and rainy periods throughout the year.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is remarkably windy in Cieliso; there is almost always at the very least a light breeze present. Windstorms occur occasionally as a natural phenomenon generated by the region's Beastlord in order to facilitate a cycle of fresh air and magic (”light”). It is unlikely for a windstorm to cause significant property damage, however, due to a series of manmade tunnels within the archipelago's structure to funnel the tempest.
        </p>
        <h3>
          History and Relations
        </h3>
        <p>
          Cieliso's territory covers most of what was considered Upper Luxos prior to the current borders arrangement. Through careful, calculated leadership, the country was raised into one of the most powerful nations in Luxos, boasting both a prosperous economy and an impressive military (Windknights).
        </p>
        <p>
          Cieliso maintains healthy, cordial alliances with both Umisuu and Pyrus, but have a somewhat strained relationship with the nation of Guashan. The conflict is primarily centered around possession of various Guashan regions that were once considered Upper Luxos territory, but the dispute has since extended to the Azure Chasm and surrounding luxic gold mines. As it stands, the strength of the Windknights as an armed force is matched only by Guashan's own military. The two nations are currently in a sorts of cold war, with Cieliso hesitating to act due to the Crystalline Monarch's strange activity.

          San Ven
        </summary>
        <p>
          San Ven's community generally values sensibility and intelligence. There are a significant amount of residents who are entrepreneurs or students. Most of the city's infrastructure and layout was built during Upper Luxos' time, with little changes to the fundamental design to this day.

          Landmarks and Facilities
        </h5>
        <p>
          <b>Castle Cieliso</b> : The place of residence for the Cielicano royal family. Along with the Vientolunas, castle staff are always present on the grounds - however, they live in their own homes outside the building. Castle Cieliso is composed of a singular main building and several floating structures connected through staircases and passageways.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Wings of San Ven</b> : The housing area, training zones, and meeting centers for the Windknights, guard and military force of Cieliso. It is a massive property positioned relatively nearby the castle.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Tradewinds Center</b> : A dense, tightly-regulated marketplace in the southern section of San Ven. Many of the merchants hosting shop in the wheel-shaped region are not actually from Cieliso, and travel to the country using Skycrafts. The marketplace operates 24/7 - some shops are only open during certain times of day, so it's recommended to keep an eye on the schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Church of Loni</b> : A place of worship for those who follow the Windborne Moon, one of the most powerful and ancient Champions. It is a brilliant location for locals to pay respects or travelers to visit/study.

        <p>
          Heralded as the academic center of Luxos, "Eliteca" refers to both the college as well as the city surrounding it. The great majority of students attend to acquire licenses, such as ones required to apply for a permit at Tradewinds or to demonstrate qualifications for a given craft, but a few seek funding or faculty for research. Some Elitecan graduates have gone on to become tutors for royals - a notable example being Cieliso's own princess.

          To the north of San Ven is the city referred to as “The Headwaters.” It is aptly named for its close proximity to the source of the Nuba River. Though not nearly as large or busy as the country's capital, Cielicano Headwaters houses its own vibrant community and relevant facilities.

          <span style="color: #47221a; font-weight: bold">The enigmatic abyssal nation.</span> Directly beneath the Cielicano Isles lies another set of islands - one suspended in the Luxic Sea. Umisuu is split into two climatic sections - Coastal Umisuu and Deep Umisuu. The former refers to the above-sea forms of the nation, while the latter applies to the depths left behind when Cieliso (Upper Luxos) rose from the sea. The capital of Umisuu, Ikoron, also serves as the primary port for the nation.

        -->
        <h3>Government</h3>
        <p>
          In general, citizens of Umisuu feel both secure and adequately recognized by their Representatives, Ryo and Ophelia. While the two are rather lenient and forgiving, they also retain firm on their policies - particularly regarding preservation of the territory and the protection of its people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ryo and Ophelia are not the only ones in charge, despite being the faces behind many of the political decisions - there are five other members within the Umisuan Council. Each councilmember holds equal weight in decisions, but represents a different facet of the Umisuan government: infrastructure, commerce, health, environment, and security.
        </p>
        <h3>Economy</h3>
        <p>
          Umisuu’s abundance of tourist traps makes it a power player in the travel industry, primarily in the capital city, Ikoron. Additionally, there are unique exports available, such as parts of Umisuan sea creatures or natural treasures within Deep Umisuu's cavity. Oftentimes these exports are shipped out in their raw or discovered state, as opposed to a processed item.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Climate
        </h3>
        <p>
          Most of Umisuu is warm and sunny. On occasion, there are intense rainstorms, but they clear up just as quickly as they arrive. It's often said that the easiest way to tell an Umisuan local from a tourist is to see how they handle storms - tourists panic at the harsh rain, while locals simply continue their regular activities as the clouds pass over within minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike the rest of the country, Deep Umisuu is very cold. This is due to the region constantly being covered in shadows cast by the Cielicano Isles. However, deep within its core is a sun-like ball gifted by Ravisi, which generates some warmth and light in the area that would otherwise be uninhabitable for any Luxic person.
        </p>
        <h3>
          History and Relations
        </h3>
        <p>
          Umisuu is on pleasant terms with all other major nations, and has been for quite a while. For this reason, the country does not have a centralized military force. Umisuu is also relatively well-respected due to its critical placement in the greater trade system in Luxos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally, Umisuu has always had close ties with Cieliso due to their proximity and shared history. It's been proven that the Cielicano Isles were pieces of Umisuu territory that had risen into the sky, leaving the region of Deep Umisuu in its absence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite its rather appealing locale, Umisuu is rather difficult to immigrate into. There aren't many plans for residential development, and the process of purchasing land gets dicey with legislation in place designed to preserve certain parts of the country's natural landscape.

The country is subdivided into three areas: North Pyrus, East Pyrus, and South Pyrus. Each region is governed by a specific noble house. While they act independently of each other, the houses will often meet to decide on greater national affairs. The climate generally runs dry, however South Pyrus has a short wet season.

Its capital, Da Qiu, is enshrouded by a treacherous range, with the only break in jagged mountains being a single, heavily-guarded path. Governed by the Crystalline Monarch, the country is closed off to outsiders without an entry permit. The exception for this strict border policy is the island of Sinocrast, as there is really no effective way to block off the entire area.
