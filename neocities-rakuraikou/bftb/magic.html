        Light
      </h2>
      <p>
        Everything on Luxos is made of "light." In this world, light can be equated to "ki" or "magical energy." <a href="people.html">People</a> on Luxos have the potential to manipulate this, but it can only be unlocked through the favor of a <a href="beastlords.html">Beastlord</a>. The type of light a Luxic person would be able to harness after a Beastlord's influence is known as an aspect.

      <h2>
        Aspects
      </h2>
      <p>
        Defined as the specific type of light a Luxic person can manipulate, aspects are more or less something that everyone has or gains at some point in their life. They are obtained from one of the four Beastlords, and each aspect is specific to a certain Beastlord. There is a limit to one's ability to perform magic: as one uses it, <a href="cael.html">cael</a> builds up in their bloodstream, which can lead to death if not accounted for.
      </p>
      <p>
        The great majority of people on Luxos is able to use one (and only one) aspect. However, <a href="keepers.html">Keepers</a> are able to use up to three depending on the Beastlord they are linked to.
