      <h2>
        Light
      </h2>
      <p>
        Everything on Luxos is made of "light." In this world, light can be equated to "ki" or "magical energy." People on Luxos have the potential to manipulate this, but it can only be unlocked through the favor of a Beastlord. The type of light a Luxic person would be able to harness after a Beastlord's influence is known as an aspect.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Aspects
      </h2>
      <p>
        Defined as the specific type of light a Luxic person can manipulate, aspects are more or less something that everyone has or gains at some point in their life. They are obtained from one of the four Beastlords, and each aspect is specific to a certain Beastlord. There is a limit to one's ability to perform magic: as one uses magic, <a href="cael.html">cael</a> builds up in their bloodstream, which can lead to death if not accounted for.
      </p>
      <p>
        The great majority of people on Luxos is able to use one (and only one) aspect. However, <a href="keepers.html">Keepers</a> are able to use up to three depending on the Beastlord they are linked to.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Beastlords
      </h2>
      <p>
        Four unfathomably magnificent creatures rule Luxos' natural world, they are known as the Beastlords of Storm, Tide, Ash and Wild. Each Beastlord is known to gift one of three aspects to an individual:
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style: none">
        <li>
          <b>Storm</b> : wind, lightning, sun
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Tide</b> : water, ice, moon
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Ash</b> : fire, crystal, dust
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Wild</b> : earth, flora, toxin
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Beastlords themselves tend to move from place to place, but frequently return to their dens. Though they can generally be found in these dens, it's quite dangerous to enter one. A Beastlord's might permeates the air around them, making it strenuous and difficult to get near.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Talismans
      </h3>
      <p>
        The physical form of the Beastlords itself holds immense power. Tufts of fur, scales, claws, and other trace materials regularly shed from the Beastlords can increase the capacity of a Luxic person's aspect in various ways just by carrying one around as a talisman. The effect a talisman has on one's abilities is dependent on which Beastlord the material comes from.
      </p>
      <p>
        Talisman materials are extremely rare - particularly because of how hard it is to even get close to a Beastlord. Additionally, with how infrequently a Beastlord sheds through natural means, it's almost impossible to naturally stumble upon a material. Because of their rarity and power-increasing quality, they are closely associated with authority. The very few people who have a talisman also happen to be rulers of some sort.
