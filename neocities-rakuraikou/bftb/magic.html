        Light
      </h2>
      <p>
        Everything on Luxos is made of "light." In this world, light can be equated to "ki" or "magical energy." <a href="people.html">People</a> on Luxos have the potential to manipulate this, but it can only be unlocked through the favor of a <a href="beastlords.html">Beastlord</a>. The type of light a Luxic person would be able to manifest and control after a Beastlord's influence is known as an aspect.

      <h2>
        Aspects
      </h2>
      <p>
        Defined as the specific type of light a Luxic person (or other lifeform) can manipulate, aspects are something obtained at the moment of creation (i.e. birth). For example, someone with a water aspect is able to transmute Luxos' light into water and control it. This person could also control water that is already present, such as from rivers and oceans. Aspects are obtained from one of the four Beastlords, and each aspect is specific to a certain Beastlord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aspects are powerful and versatile, and Luxic people have explored many applications and techniques over time. However, despite its great potential, there is a limit to one's ability to use an aspect: as one uses it, <a href="cael.html">cael</a> builds up in their bloodstream. A dangerous waste byproduct, high cael buildup can lead to serious consequences (and ultimately death) if left untreated or unaccounted for.
      </p>
      <p>
        The great majority of people on Luxos are able to use one (and only one) aspect. However, <a href="keepers.html">Keepers</a> are able to use up to three depending on the Beastlord they are linked to.
