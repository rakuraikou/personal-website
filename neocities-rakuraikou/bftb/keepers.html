      <h2>
        Keepers
      </h2>
      <p>
        Each Beastlord is linked to a Keeper. Blessed from birth, Keepers are Luxic people with a special bond with their respective Beastlord. This bond allows them access to their Beastlord's thoughts and feelings, as well as potential to utilize all three of its governed aspects.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main duty of a Keeper is to facilitate communication between Luxic people and their linked Beastlord. The way this responsibility manifests varies bewteen relationships, but generally pertains to the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Rituals to sate/appease the Beastlord (... it's not favorable to be on the bad side of something like that)
        </li>
        <li>
          Helping out townspeople and investigating dangerous requests ("Hometown Hero" tasks)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Technically, Keepers don't <i>need</i> to do anything. Their connection to their Beastlord isn't increased or decreased based on effort put into maintaining the link. However, a negligent Keeper may find that a displeased Beastlord can cause great havoc upon the land.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Champions
      </h2>
      <p>
        When a Keeper dies, another is born immediately after. If enough people hold a late Keeper's legacy in high regards, then they can offer their light to preserve that Keeper's soul. Keepers who persist after death in this way are called Champions. Champions can act completely on their own whim and desire, but can only exist in and interact with Luxos with consistent offerings of light. It's common for Champions to grant natural miracles - such as sparks to provide flame on a cold night or richer soils for a fruitful harvest - in exchange for offerings. Though they don't have a physical form of their own, Champions can temporarily manifest in areas where substantial amounts of light have been collected.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Pacts and Acolytes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Offering light yields similar effects to using an aspect - the individual making the sacrifice accumulates cael. Should one desire a more consistent relationship with a Champion, they can form a pact and become an acolyte. There are strict conditions and guidelines regarding a pact, and failure to keep one's end of the bargain results in immediate consequence.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the forming of a pact, the acolyte and Champion agree on a schedule of sorts for drawing light. This is a practice that is done in private and cannot be "rescheduled" once established. The procedure renders the acolyte temporarily unaware of their surroundings and is typically painless. The Champion can only take a fixed amount of light per session, an agreed-upon volume that is within caelism levels. However, if an acolyte is not careful and accumulates a significant amount of cael prior to the session, they risk suffering from caelism anyway from the Champion's tap.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a pact, the Champion is able to directly speak to the acolyte, allowing them to more reliably interact with Luxos. The Champion also gains a small but consistent flow of light to maintain existence. The acolyte in turn receives more powerful miracles at their request. Acolytes additionally tend to be well-respected in society due to their devotion to their pacts, receiving special services for their great sacrifice.
