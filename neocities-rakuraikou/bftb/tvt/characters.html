								<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader">The Leader</a>: Araceli, defined by her determination

				<p>
					A mysterious girl who washed up on the shores of Buragee just over ten years before the attack on Castle Cieliso, and the <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">Protagonist</a> of <i>Bolt from the Blue</i>. Devoid of any memories of her past, she serves as Araceli's personal attendant, happily satisfying all of the curious princess' whims. Optimistic and friendly, Raiden is always open to lending a helping hand to anyone in need, <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">believing wholeheartedly in the strength of being kind</a>.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<!--raiden tropes-->
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">All-Loving Hero</a>: Raiden has a lot of patience with others and a great capacity to forgive. She is willing to go out of her way to help others, even complete strangers
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>: <span class="spoiler">Died after falling into an abyss, but was brought back with the power of the Beastlord of Light</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a>: Though Castle Cieliso has graciously given her a basic education, she's clearly outsmarted by most other characters in the story
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">Chronic Hero Syndrome</a>: Her overbearing kindness drives her to right every wrong she happens to stumble upon in her journey through Luxos
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyImpressed">Easily Impressed</a>: Blown away by just about everything new that she sees (which is... everything, <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">technically</a>)
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFool">The Fool</a>: Without her memories, Raiden seems pretty naive and aimless. For most of the story, her entire reason for sticking around is because <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyAndKnight">she swore to never leave Araceli's side</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealerSignsOnEarly">Healer Signs On Early</a>: The first character the player gets to use in battle, and she comes with a basic single-target healing skill.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSOD</a>: Particularly when Raiden learns that <span class="spoiler">she is the fifth Beastlord, and <i>that's</i> why Nox Noctis is targeting her. It troubles her quite deeply, but <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmWhatIAm">she gets over it</a>.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdentityAmnesia">Identity Amnesia</a>: This is slightly downplayed in the beginning half of the story as after ten years in San Ven, she's organically developed a new sense of identity. <span class="spoiler">This actually becomes a greater plot point when <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionControl">Ilia gets involved</a>.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyAndKnight">Lady and Knight</a>: The knight to Araceli's lady. Raiden technically isn't enlisted in the Windknights, but she swears to serve Araceli in a similar fashion (<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardingABadass">though Araceli herself doesn't seem to need that kind of protection</a>). As an attendant, Raiden's role is actually more general than bodyguarding.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero">Magnetic Hero</a>: Her ability to connect with others is her trick to overcoming every obstacle.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>: She's literally the nicest character in <i>Bolt from the Blue</i>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName">Only One Name</a>: Doesn't have a last name.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PastLifeMemories">Past-Life Memories</a>: Starting with zero memories, Raiden regains a small trace of her past at the end of each chapter in the game.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">Person of Mass Destruction</a>: <span class="spoiler">She's a Beastlord, an entity well-established with the power to create and destroy realms.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">Shock and Awe</a>: Raiden has a lightning aspect. <span class="spoiler">As it turns out, however, the lightning aspect was just a residual piece of Raiden before reincarnation. Raiden is actually the formerly-dormant Beastlord of <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightEmUp">Light</a>, a powerful being with the ability to command the very <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureEnergy">life and magic on Luxos</a>.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StevenUlyssesPerhero">Steven Ulysses Perhero</a>: The name "Raiden" means god of lightning.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockShonenHero">Stock Sh≈çnen Hero</a>: A pretty snug fit for this trope. Raiden is kindhearted, simple-minded, and has a unique and powerful ability. Her entire philosphy is rooted in <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a>, has a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShonenHair">Shonen Hair</a> style, and is hopelessly <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">Oblivious to Love</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictorGainsLosersPowers">Victor Gains Loser's Powers</a>: Heartbolt, an ability which triggers at certain parts in the story, such as after certain character subquests. It has some narrative significance <span class="spoiler">as the action of embracing and taking in some of a Luxic person's light</span>, but in-game it gives Raiden a new combat skill based on whichever character she used the ability on.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorTherapist">Warrior Therapist</a>: Justified thanks to Heartbolt, a power that allows her to personally understand her opponent's passions, values and fears. 
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson">The Watson</a>: <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Conveniently has very little sense of how the world of Luxos operates or what societies lie within it</a>. The other three party members take their own respective roles in explaining it all to her.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWakeUpOnABeach">You Wake Up on a Beach</a>: Her earliest memory is washing up on the shores of Buragee

				<p>The <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist">Deuteragonist</a> of <i>Bolt from the Blue</i>, Araceli is a princess who embraces her position as the heir to the Cielicano throne. Despite her ambitions and successes, <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenPrincess">a particular failure shines above all the rest - she cannot control her moon aspect</a>. Fated to be the savior against a dark force, Araceli deeply laments her lack of magical ability. When the prophesized dark force threatens her home, she is left with no choice but to flee with her attendant. Araceli hopes to return with the power to take back her kingdom.</p>
				<hr>
				<!--araceli tropes-->
				<ul>

						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTics">Character Tics</a>: Bites her thumb or knuckle when anxious or lost in thought.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a>: Subverted. As fated by a reading at House Infiaco's Night of the Stars, Araceli was to be the key to stopping a ruinous attack on Castle Cieliso. Unfortunately, she could not unlock the ability to overcome the opposing force, leading to the downfall of her kingdom. <span class="spoiler">Double Subverted when she does return to Cieliso at the game's climax and faces the assailants head-on.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosetKey">Closet Key</a>: Read a lot of heterosexual YA novels growing up, but would project Raiden onto the male love interest, leading to the realization that she is a lesbian.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConfidant">The Confidant</a>: She is the first person who Cole confides to about what happened to The Four Skulls and her guilt regarding the matter. <span class="spoiler">However, Cole carefully omits her affiliation with Nox Noctis...</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenPrincess">Fallen Princess</a>: The perfect heir, aside from her inability to wield her own aspect. This results in the attack on her home kingdom succeeding.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Foil</a>: To Saffron. Both are of high status and their respective families hold some degree of doubts towards them regarding succession. However, Araceli was going to inherit Cieliso anyway, until the sudden attack caused her to flee. On the other hand, Saffron is not the intended heir, and is actually bitter of Araceli's privileged position.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">My Greatest Failure</a>: Failing to fulfill a prophecy to save San Ven from ruin, even though it's literally not her fault.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyAndKnight">Lady and Knight</a>: The lady to Raiden's knight. Raiden's role is less of a protective knight and more of a personal escort/servant, but Araceli seems to appreciate that plenty.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader">The Leader</a>: Of the headstrong flavor. Araceli's determination to grow strong and return home (combined with Raiden's <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">Chronic Hero Syndrome</a>, for better or worse) is what gets the main party swept into all kinds of adventures and errands. <span class="spoiler">This is further reinforced with the "final" chapter of the game beginning with a return to Cieliso.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeFatherLikeSon">Like Father, Like Daughter</a>: Araceli valuing the fate of her kingdom to a deep, martyr-like level comes directly from her dad's influence and guidance.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lunacy">Lunacy</a>: Araceli has a moon aspect.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Power Incontinence</a>: Inverted. She cannot use her moon aspect on her own, depending on the Aurous Saber for menial casting.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyPrincessPowerhouse">Pretty Princess Powerhouse</a>: Extremely adept at swordfighting, even against multiple opponents at once. She also has better offensive stats than her attendant, Raiden.

					</li>
					<li>

				<p>
					The second-born son of South Pyrus' House Infiaco, Saffron is a scholarly noble who believes that he should inherit the House instead of his older brother, looking for every reason to present to his family. Sent to Castle Cieliso to go over some embassy paperwork and <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">meet with its princess, Araceli</a>, his seemingly mundane afternoon is suddenly crushed by an attack by a vicious entity. Alongside Araceli and her attendant, Raiden, Saffron is thrown into an adventure - one that he realizes is just what he needs to prove himself back home.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<!--saffron tropes-->
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a>: Saffron is renown as an exceptionally powerful fire aspect wielder in Pyrus, contrasting Araceli's reputation.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBabyOfTheBunch">The Baby of the Bunch</a>: Downplayed. Saffron is the youngest of the main four. He's occasionally teased about this by the oldest of the group, Cole, despite only being a couple years younger.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">Break the Haughty</a>: Gets knocked down a peg in Pyrus Chapter when <span class="spoiler">Karma Selvatilla effortlessly shows him the true might of a Head of a noble house.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe">Casanova Wannabe</a>: Defied. He was really only this way with Araceli and stops when she discloses that she is a lesbian. Actually, after this point, he starts hating <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">Casanovas</a> himself, notably Raymond, Cole, and - to some extent - Bijou (though he's more of a Wannabe).
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaQueen">Drama Prince</a>: Played for laughs. He's just a spoiled noble who's way out of touch with reality.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireIsRed">Fire is Red</a>: Subverted. The Infiaco family's fire aspect wielders channel golden flames.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Foil</a>: To Araceli. Both are of high status and their respective families hold some degree of doubts towards them regarding succession. However, Araceli was going to inherit Cieliso anyway, until the sudden attack caused her to flee. On the other hand, Saffron is not the intended heir, and is actually bitter of Araceli's privileged position.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex">Inferiority Superiority Complex</a>: He's not quiet about his accolades and abilities in the slightest. Unfortunately, the whole "inheriting the noble house" thing is a sore spot for him, and he's secretly afraid that this whole journey to prove himself will just end in utter embarrassment.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a>: A brilliant scholar with great theoretical knowledge on how people work... Emphasis on <i>theoretical</i>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyNameIsInigoMontoya">My Name is Inigo Montoya</a>: In several confrontations, most notably (and ironically, since they are established to already know each other) <span class="spoiler">Karma</span>, he introduces himself as "Saffron Infiaco, second-born son of House Infiaco."
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">Lethal Chef</a>: Very much cannot cook due to a lack of kitchen sense. Even if he's preparing meals with someone who <i>can</i> cook (like Cole), he will very strongly insist on <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CordonBleughChef">adding bizarre ingredients and seasonings to "improve taste"</a> 
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">Playing with Fire</a>: Saffron has a fire aspect.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShelteredAristocrat">Sheltered Aristocrat</a>: Painfully out of touch with lifestyles outside that of himself and other nobles.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood">Royal Blood</a>: House Infiaco.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyaltySuperpower">Royalty Superpower</a>: Each noble house of Pyrus has a special power inherited by its members: for House Infiaco, this power is future sight. The potency at which members of the bloodline can use this ability varies - Saffron unfortunately is on <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">the less impressive end of this spectrum</a>, only able to vaguely perceive events within the next day.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a>: Saffron the highest INT stat and cael limit out of the main party and a versatile array of skills, but he's lacking in pretty much every other department when it comes to combat.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessfulSiblingSyndrome">Successful Sibling Syndrome</a>: Saffron's older brother, Raymond, is extremely well-liked by others. Raymond also has an exceptional cael limit and natural talent for magic, rivaling and occasionally eclipsing that of Saffron. It's clear that Raymond would make a suitable Head, except <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWrongfulHeirToTheThrone">he wouldn't</a>...
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoesSheSeeInHim">What Does She See In Her?</a>: Saffron is confused by Araceli's affections for Raiden, seeing the latter as rather unremarkable.

					Formerly first mate of the infamous sky pirates crew, The Four Skulls, Cole leaves her powerful position after a dark tragedy and resides alone in her own skycraft. After solo pirating for a few years, she finds some stowaways on the run from an attack on the nearby castle.
