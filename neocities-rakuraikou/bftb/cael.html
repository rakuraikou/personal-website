        Cael

      <p>
        When Luxic people use their aspect to manipulate light, a harmful magic compound builds up within their bodies. Known as cael, this plasma-like substance is manifested in the bloodstream and is relatively innocuous in small amounts. Low cael buildup manifests as exhaustion, fatigue and muscle aches. Cael within the body will dispel on its own eventually, but rest and hydration will speed up the recovery process. Some people dispel cael more quickly than others due to a biological predisposition (such as a higher metabolism). 
      </p>
      <p>
        In higher accumulations, an individual may suffer a condition known as caelism. Common tells for caelism include weakened or impaired bodily functions (such as difficulty breathing or slower wound healing) and a telltale "bruising" or "blighting" across various parts of the body. Caelism takes a great amount of time to run its complete course before recovery. Generally, this amount of time is far more than most Luxic people are comfortable with waiting for, so specific medicine has been developed to break up mass amounts of cael in the body for quicker healing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though caelism is very dangerous, prognosis is rarely ever certain death. Caelism initially presents itself in a localized area - if aggravated, it will travel to the user's heart, where it will likely become fatal. Once symptoms are recognized, it is recommended that the user find immediate medical care and rest accordingly. It's considered common sense to avoid using more magic at all costs once caelism manifests.
