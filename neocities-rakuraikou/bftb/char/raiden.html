              <p>Raiden is an optimistic, cheerful individual whose kind heart knows no limits. She will always extend a helping hand to anyone in need, even if others disagree. Though her agreeable demeanor may seem na√Øve, Raiden sees little reason to act in any other way. Raiden finds strength in being kind, and as long as she navigates each decision with good intentions, she's sure that everything else will see itself through.</p>
              <p class="nonspoiler">It's been ten years since Raiden washed up on the shores of Ikoron. With no memories or home to go to, she was graciously taken in by the ruler of a neighboring kingdom. There, she resided in Castle Cieliso, serving as the princess' primary attendant. Between training with the Windknights and satisfying the curious princess' whims, Raiden doesn't really have the room to wonder about her past. Not that it bothers her, or anything.</p>
              <p class="spoiler">It's been ten years since Raiden was resurrected from the dead through some dark miracle. With zero knoweldge of who she was before, she opted to choose kindness at every opportunity. Though it's not the most practical or advantageous route, she believes that this is the best course of action.</p>
              <p class="spoiler">Most of the time, the lack of memories don't bother Raiden too much. She's seen countless instances of people being burdened and suffering <i>because</i> of their past experiences. But when she witnesses those with deep bonds to cherish, those with something meaningful and joyful that <i>depend</i> on having hung onto the past, she has the quiet realization that perhaps she is missing out on quite a bit. After all, what <i>is</i> a person other than their memories?</p>
              <p class="spoiler">Raiden's entire existence is a mystery, but the greatest secret (one not even Raiden herself is privy to) is the purpose of the cuffs on her wrists. It seems to not affect Raiden's quality of life, but they're impossible for her to remove. Though, a suspicious group known as Nox Noctis seems to be fixated on her and these cuffs.</p>
