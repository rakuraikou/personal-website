                Saffron is the second-born son of House Infiaco, and he is very proud of this fact. As much as he'd like to inherit the role of Head of House, it seems his older brother has seniority. Convinced that he would be far more suited in the position, Saffron constantly pesters his mother to reconsider. His mother gives him but one response: Saffron just doesn't have what it takes, and until he acquires it, the position will be inherited by the eldest child as it always had before.
              </p>
              <p>
                Seeking to prove himself as a worthy successor, Saffron volunteers to spearhead a great political endeavor on behalf of his family; he will make and push forward the arrangements for an allience with the Kingdom of Cieliso. With his prized possession, a mysterious amulet he picked up from an old box in his home, he will embark on a trip to San Ven. Unfortunately, it would seem that he was way in over his head, and this undertaking was far more complex than he imagined.
              </p>
              <p>
                Saffron's quest is interrupted by an unusual attack, but he's not discouraged in the slightest. In fact, he sees the journey that follows as a means to prove himself in a truly exceptional way and finally be taken seriously by those around him.
