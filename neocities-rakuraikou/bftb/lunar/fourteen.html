              In a way, Raiden is a lot like Damien from End of Summer. She's caring, strong, and she's so mysterious. Though, I hope she's not so similar that her father is also a dark lord. That would be awkward at best. Like Damien, Raiden also loves eating fruits, but Damien's way more mischievous about it. He likes to take food from Ashe's bag and eat it right in front of her. Raiden usually waits until I share, but sometimes she'll ask first if it's something she likes. Damien calls Ashe "Goldie," which is supposed to be an endearing nickname, but Ashe always pouts at it. Deep down, Ashe likes the nickname though.

              I'd like for Raiden to give me a nickname, too, but she doesn't call me anything aside from "princess" or "Princess Araceli." I wonder if I should tell her...
