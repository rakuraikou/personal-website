              Today we're going to host a memorial for my mother. We have one every year, but I haven't really thought much of it until now. I'm told that we don't really know what happened, just that it was a little bit after I was born. 
            </p>

              Sometimes I wonder what she's like. Maybe she's strong and isn't a late bloomer like me. What would she think of me? I work so hard for the kingdom, I'm certain she'd be proud.
            </p>

              What would she think of Raiden? In my head, my mother was probably a kind woman, and she'd probably want to help Raiden. Maybe she'd feel happy because Raiden helps out so much.
            </p>

              I think even without my mother around, I am still okay. I have my father and the Windknights to help me learn and grow. It does make me a little sad at times, I wish I could at least meet her. But, I think it's alright. After the memorial today, I'm going to be visiting Loni at the church again. It'll be a busy day!
