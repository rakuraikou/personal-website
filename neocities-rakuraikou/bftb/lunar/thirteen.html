              I've been reading a lot of books lately, my favorite being End of Summer by P. Rose. It's about a girl name Ashe Goldsol who goes on a great journey with a mysterious prince to defeat the dark lord and free the land of Faralor. I think Ashe is a really fantastic character, her goal to bring peace to Faralor is challenged at every turn, but she overcomes each obstacle. The dashing prince, Damien, just adds another layer to her character. When it turns out that Damien's father is the very dark lord himself, Ashe has to decide if she can still trust him. It's a great story, and I heard there's a sequel!

              Raiden and I have gotten really close over the years. Sometimes I think about going on a big adventure like that with her. Maybe after all of this prophecy stuff is over with, I can use my strength to take her all around Luxos. There's so much I haven't seen yet, and I want her to see it with me.
