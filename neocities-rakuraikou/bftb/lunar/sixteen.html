              Apparently there have been reports of a pirate seizing turf in the Skysea. I had initially wondered how fearsome of a crew the invaders must be if they are aiming to take over part of the port, but I was informed that there was only one individual involved. What kind of fool would take on an area frequented by pirates on their own? The Windknights have been keeping a close eye on the situation. The pirate is a young woman with her own skycraft. She has yet to commit any major crimes - perhaps she's playing it safe so that the Windknights don't see her eviction as a priority? I wonder what she's even doing here...

              Anyway, I had considered breaking my pact with Loni of Twilight the other day. Ultimately, I decided against it as there would likely be more trouble than it's worth. At least, that's what the ex-acolytes at the church told me. I just felt like the pact wasn't doing much for me, but I suppose there's no harm in continuing to try. It's not like I'm using my light for much else.

              Raiden and I are headed to the meadow later today. With the weather warming up, maybe we'll get to see some fresh blooms or waking wildlife. I look forward to it!
