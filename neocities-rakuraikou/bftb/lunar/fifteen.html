              Okay, I think I may have feelings for Raiden. I wasn't quite sure about it before, but I am now. It's like I see her in everything: the books I read, various locations around San Ven... Lights, I visited Ms. Verona to treat my recent hand injury, and I couldn't stop thinking about when Raiden would ease the pain with her magic- can you believe that? Healing with a lightning aspect? She's really something...

              It's all so embarrassing to think about, let alone write down, but at least I can get it out here. That way I won't have to embarrass myself anywhere else.
            </p>

              It feels like every day I'm finding new things to like about her, even if every day she is just the same as she was the day before. How is that possible? She's always found new ways to surprise me, yet she doesn't seem to try at all.
