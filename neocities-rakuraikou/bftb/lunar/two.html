              Today, Roga gave me this journal to use as I please!!! I really like how soft the cover is, so I'll keep it protected by never taking it out of my room!

              Next month, I'm going to Embra for a big event: Night of the Stars. My father tells me they only have it once every 10 years, which means the last time was right before I was born. That is really interesting, and I wonder how long they've been doing this??! He also said that I can get my future read here by the Head of House Infiaco herself, which also sounds interesting.

              Before we go, I have to go see Ms. Verona for a check-up. I have to see her a lot to make sure I'm healthy. I'm not actually sick. Well, not that sick. Ms. Verona just says that I am a late bloomer, and that's why my aspect isn't strong yet. I'm sure once I grow up, I'll be very strong!!
