              I got to see Lady Catherine, who is the Head of House Infiaco, and she told me that I would get to meet a new friend soon! Isn't that wonderful?? Then she went to speak with my father, and I spent the rest of the night with Young Lord Saffron. He's only a little bit annoying, but it's okay. The night was pretty nice, and a lot of people complimented my dress.

              Now that I'm home, my father wants me to visit the church sometimes to see Loni. One day I'm going to have a pact with her!! My father tells me she will help me get stronger. I go there twice a week with one of the Windknights. The church isn't that far so he should just let me go alone but he says it's safer this way. I think he is worrying over nothing! But I still listen to him because that's the right thing to do.

              The church is really big...and old. There's a really really big bell on top, but I've never seen them ring it. I asked one of the Windknights why they don't and he said he didn't know. I asked if I could go see it and he said no. I really want to see it though!!!
