              I'm 12 now, which means I have a lot of responsibility. More Loni time at church, more training with the Windknights. It's super exhausting to work this hard, but Raiden doesn't really get it. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I still like spending time with her, but not all of the time! Sometimes I'm busy, and sometimes I want to just rest. She's been trying to make a habit of taking me to the meadow. When I get too tired, she offers to carry me. I don't know how she has so much energy, I guess it's because she doesn't have to work hard like I do.
            </p>
            <p>
              Raiden may not totally understand it, but I have to do everything I can for the kingdom. I'm still not ready to face the prophecy, my magic has hardly improved. Everyone has faith in me, though, and I'm sure if I keep working at it, I will make everyone proud and keep the kingdom safe.
