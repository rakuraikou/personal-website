              Raiden says that she woke up in Buragee and was brought to the castle pretty recently. She seems happy to be here, and I'm happy too!! I like to sit and read with Raiden, and I like when she comes with me to the church instead of a Windknight. I have a lot of training for different skills, and sometimes she will try to join me! She likes to ask what I'm doing, so I think she likes being my friend too.
            </p>

              To be honest, the church visits and the training get really tiring, all of this pact stuff is overwhelming and exhausting. Raiden always tries to find ways to make things easier for me. Sometimes she carries me home on her back, she's so strong!! I like her so much.

              My father tells me there's a really important prophecy where something evil tries to attack the kingdom. But I'm going to be strong enough to stop it. I have to be, so that's why I train and see Loni of Twilight, so that I can have strong magic to help my people!
