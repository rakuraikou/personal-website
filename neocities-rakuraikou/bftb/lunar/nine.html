              I started my 14th birthday with a visit to Loni of Twilight. I think she's been talking to me less. Maybe she's also giving up on me. Even if it's true, I can't really be sad about it, since I still have to be the one to stop the evil force that's going to attack San Ven, I think. Am I really supposed to live up to that one day? I don't even know.
            </p>

              ...It really isn't something I should be worrying about on my birthday. After that, I bought some books and returned to the castle. Everyone was busy preparing for the party, except for Raiden, since her entire job is just following me around. Oh yeah, the party itself was pretty standard: lots of other nobles to greet, lots of things to eat and drink, dancing, etc. I tried to play off my worries - we've been keeping the prophecy (and my...shortcomings...) a secret. Also, it would look bad if I was upset at my own birthday party.

              I think Raiden knew something was off, which shocked me because not even Roga or my father caught on. She took me to my room so we could speak in private, and I ended up sharing more than I had anticipated. All she said was she wished she could do more. I wish she could too, but it was nice to talk.
