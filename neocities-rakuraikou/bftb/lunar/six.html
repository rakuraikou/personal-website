              Spending time with Raiden is so fun!! We read books together and go to training and church together. She is always so nice to me and saying nice things.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Windknights (well mostly Roga) used to take me to the meadow outside the kingdom to play, but I haven't been there in a while. Raiden says she's never seen a meadow, isn't that crazy?!? How can you be 10 years old and never go to a meadow?? I want to go again and take Raiden there.
            </p>
            <p>
              We like to read adventure books together! Sometimes Roga reads with us too, but sometimes she's too busy. Sometimes I get busy too, but Raiden gets to go with me anywhere as long as I stay focused. That's what my father said anyway. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Reading with Raiden is fun, but we also like to draw the characters too. The books usually don't have pictures, so we like to draw our own. Raiden says I'm very good at drawing, isn't that nice? I like drawing with Raiden so much!
