              at sunday school, they kept telling me that jesus from the bible was best known for turning his cheek like that.

              lol, come on. his hands were tied to that damn cross long before a Roman ever laid eyes on him.

              though, in a way, my hands were tied, too. but not to a cross.

              jealousy implies that i had something to lose. i don't. i just envy those who do.

              it once felt like everything moved forward without me. like i was standing in the stream and everyone else was just floating through it, and i was just wondering why i was being left behind.
            </p>
            <p style="color:#1d5786">
              god, honestly, it's like i'm drowning now. everyone's still drifting forward without me, but now i'm sinking and sinking and sinking - the blues of the water obscuring anything left to envy, i cannot even remember what life is like above the surface. i cannot fathom the warmth of the sun on my back that cradled me even in my weakest. it's too late to do anything now. if i try, i'll just make it worse. maybe i'm actually swimming in quicksand.

            <p style="color:#0f2468">
              i often have dreams about being underwater. i always held my breath, but then when i couldn't anymore i'd learn that i could actually breathe down there. after all, it was a dream. i'd have a moment of amazement - wow, no way! i can breathe underwater! it was amazing, finally i could have a chance at kicking my way out of here! but the excitement of it all stirs me awake, and i am reminded that my reality is not that simple. just breathing isn't enough.

              you dip your toes in and the coolness of the water around you soothes all aches, the brackishness stinging for just a moment before you're nothing but numb. for once, you feel like you belong somewhere. you feel at home in the bottom of the ocean's heart.

              but with each passing wave, the surface gets just a bit further away. you don't notice it <span style="color:#0b3a46">(nobody really does at first)</span>. but, at some point, you look all around and wonder where the hell all this water came from, as if you weren't the one to stand here in the first place. you <i>know</i> what an ocean is.
            </p>
            <p style="color:#105855">
              you wonder if climate change has anything to do with the rising waters, but the truth is you wouldn't have to wonder that at all <span style="color:#2d9b57">if you just got up and left sooner</span>. it's too late now, though. you can't even see your legs.
            </p>
            <p style="color:#0b3a46">
              you look up at the water's surface, unable to make out the sky from its film. it's like looking into heaven, and even though you can't <i>really</i> see it, you actually feel like you're staring god in the eye as you sink further and further. you wish he'd lend a hand and pull you free. you wish anyone would. but he doesn't. and neither does anyone else.

            <p>
              it's a longing, isn't it? these are the warm welcomes, those very flames that singe me from the inside out. it's a calling, a beckoning with a wave from a still, pale hand. their blood looks just like mine.
