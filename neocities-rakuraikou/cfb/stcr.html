            <p>
              today i looked up from the monotony of evening's cradle and worried that i had forgotten to water my plants outside. if i even water them a few hours late, i'll find they've wilted sadly, hunching over, toiled in the morning sun.
            </p>
            <p>
              it didn't take me long to remember that i had, in fact, watered my plants. though, it wasn't because i had the memory of drawing water to soil. the image that instead flashed to my mind was one of a man walking into the unit beside mine. i remembered greeting him, saying “good morning.”
            </p>
            <p>
              the philosophy that we are our memories presented itself in my late-day jolt of botanic panic. but, beyond that, we are the trails our memories make. stumbling to take out my phone and check the time just to be sure it truly was appropriate to wish a good “morning” has nothing to do with my daily plant care regime, but i had only struggled to do so because i had been carrying my watering can and trying to open the front door at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
              i tend to grow anxious wondering what others think of me. unable to clear my own perception of myself, i would stay up late at night with this wonder, hoping that someone (anyone) could just tell me what they thought of me. to tell me what i am to them, to tell me who i am at all.
            </p>
            <p>
              but it's so simple, isn't it? i am the memories of me. but as described before, i am not just the memories themselves, but the twists and turns and trails and trials. to my lover, for example, i am not just the memory of catching the lizard that ran behind her grandmother's dresser with a pair of giant crochet needles.
            </p>
            <p>
              i am the memory of the needles themselves - i am when my beloved can now look at those needles and laugh as she recalls seeing me pressed between the wall and a hard place, trying to squeeze through just another inch, because even those monstrous rods of wood were still not long enough to grab that fickle reptile.

              i thought very hard on that, you know. to the point where i could've sworn that i had understood it.

            <h4 id="on-brother">on: brother</h4>
            <p>
              thinking about the time i beat up a kid who was bullying my brother
            </p>
            <p>
              it was the only time i ever fought someone
            </p>
            <p>
              yeah.
            </p>
            <p>
              years later i'd get ripped to shreds in high school but i never did anything to those kids. i definitely could've and maybe i should've
            </p>
            <p>
              but in 5th grade there was this boy who would come to our yard just to kick my brother out of our own trampoline and say mean shit to him
            </p>
            <p>
              so one of those days, when he came to kick my brother out, i followed him into the trampoline and beat the shit out of him
            </p>
            <p>
              my brother used to be such a wimpy ass pushover. pretty much everyone ever took a bite at him. at some point i did too. i regret it every day and try to make up for it when i can. which is hard since now i'm in florida and the most i can do is just call him
            </p>
            <p>
              he was showing me his apartment “dinner setup” today lol
            </p>
            <p>
              included a “fireplace ambiance” video playing on his tv
