        Shoal Shares
      </h2>
      <p>
        Shoal Shares (SS) are channels in DSA where creators can form sub-communities around their ideas, worlds and projects. SS channels are intended to encourage creators to develop consistentlyâ€”and inspire others in the process. SS have fostered all sorts of subjects, including OCverses, game/comic/book dev, roleplay groups, and personal art challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every channel is a dedicated space run by a passionate server member (or multiple members). All server rules still apply in these channels, but those in charge are free to set their own additional regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        SS channels are bound to a set of terms, but if members feel too pressured by these, or their ideas are too early to comfortably set up a SS channel for, they may instead create a Trial Isle post. Trial Isle posts are still individually-dedicated spaces, but they are smaller-scale and a little quieter.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Terms of Use
      </h3>
      <p>
        By applying for a SS channel, members acknowledge that they have read and agree to these terms.
      </p>
      <div class="scrollbox" style="height: 200px">
        <h4>
          Channel Ownership
        </h4>
        <p>
          Only one channel may be owned at a time. The exception to this is when the SS is developed by multiple users (collaborative). Collaborative projects are denoted with a <span style="background-color: #3498db">blue</span> role instead of a <span style="background-color: #2ecc71">green</span> one
        </p>
        <h4>
          Content Ownership
        </h4>
        <p>
          Users retain all the rights to the ideas and content they send. DSA owns none of the content, and it will never be shared officially under the server's name or claimed as property of the server. However, some messages may be used in promotional material for the server itself (such as in the forum ad). In these cases, permission will be asked prior to usage
        </p>
        <h4>
          Application Process
        </h4>
        <p>
          The contents of the application itself have very little impact on the likelihood that a SS will be approved. Generally, a decent standing within the server is means for approval. Application contents are only shared with mods
        </p>
        <h4>
          Channel Subject
        </h4>
        <p>
          SS channels must be centered around a single project or universe. Side-stories, AUs, and the like are acceptable as long as they are justifiably related to the channel's original subject
        </p>
        <h4>
          Subject Change
        </h4>
        <p>
          If a user would like to change the subject of their channel, they must submit a new application and specify that it is a project change. The user's original channel will be removed, and the new one will take its place. Simply renaming a channel (but retaining its subject) does not require a new application
        </p>
        <h4>
          Channel Activity
        </h4>
        <p>
          In order to be considered active, the channel must not remain unused for more than three weeks. "Activity" is defined as discussion/content about the channel's subject. It is NOT "I want to talk about this but I am too busy" or similar statements. A mod will send a check-in message after 2-3 weeks of perceived inactivity. After three unaddressed warnings, your channel will be permanently removed.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Holds and Hiatuses
        </h4>
        <p>
          The SS activity timer can be put on hold/hiatus at any point by informing a mod in the help channel or by DM'ing Len. No reason needs to be provided to make this request, but the SS owner must provide a date of return. The timer will be paused until this date, and the user can extend their hiatus if needed. Indefinite hiatuses are NOT allowed.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Self-Promotion
        </h4>
        <p>
          Any and all promotion related to the channel's subject may be sent here, unaffected by Community News rules. All promotion must still be SFW
        </p>
        <h4>
          Deletion
        </h4>
        <p>
          SS channels will never be deleted by a mod without prior notice or warning. Mods will delete a channel in the following scenarios:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Following a subject change request</li>
          <li>Three unaddressed inactivity notices</li>
          <li>The user leaves the server</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Users may delete their own channel at any point in time, and are not required to give a reason or explanation for doing so
        </p>
        <h4>
          Archiving of the Channel
        </h4>
        <p>
          SS channels may be archived in an offline file format per the request of the user. This archive is taken using DiscordChatExporter, and done by Len. The user will receive a .zip file containing the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>.html file containing the entirety of the channel's messages (with Discord night mode formatting)</li>
          <li>folder with all of the media files from the channel</li>
          <li>.txt file with instructions on usage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This archive can be requested at any point in time and are not taken by any server staff for any reason other than on SS owner request.</p>

      <h3>
        Usage of Shoal Shares
      </h3>
      <p>
        There are a variety of ways that members have utilized SS channels, including collaborative roleplay group planning, game development, comic creation, and general worldbuilding. Channels have housed character art, lore rambles, Picrew dumps, Spotify playlists, update links, to-do lists, AU content, and more!
