      <h2>
        Inspirations/"Dent List"
      </h2>
      <p>
        TWPS is first and foremost informed by my personal university experience - specifically the transition from high school to university. Throughout high school, I was considered a little too "weird" among my peers for one metric or another. I would obsess over muting whatever trait it happened to be in an attempt to fit in. Obviously, this wasn't a happy or healthy experience. When I got to college, I had the opportunity to start fresh and curate my own environment. There, I met people who thought those "weird" metrics were cool and valuable / worth treasuring...Yeah. Here's some other bits of inspiration!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The TWPS brand (losers worshipping a (fake) god and believing they have (fake) magic) comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9zkhdKYKJE">esuriit's chorus battle cover of Love is the Servant of Chaos</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Various "shenanigans" clubs in anime, such as Mob Psycho 100's Telepathy Club, K-On!'s Light Music Club, and Kagerou Project's Mekakushi Dan
        </li>
        <li>
          Nichijou's nonchalant/"played straight" approach to hilariously bizarre situations
        </li>
      </ul>

        Shoutout to my uni friend group. I treasure all of the nature walks, film camera photoshoots, the playlist roulette, red lights ran, Arboretum struggles (and copes), aquarium fixation, wagecucking jokes, forest entomology labs, student center lunches, and everything else. Thank you for showing me a world that loved me just as much as I loved it.
